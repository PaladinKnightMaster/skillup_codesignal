## Executing Two Containers in Detached Mode

Fantastic work so far! In this task, you'll further build your skills by executing two containers in **detached mode**:

1. **Start an existing container**:

    * A container named `my-nginx-1` has already been created for you. Use the `docker start` command to execute this existing container into detached mode.

2. **Run a new container**:

    * Using the `nginx` image, run a new container named `my-nginx-2` in detached mode with the `docker run -d` command.

Once you've completed both tasks, click `Submit` to ensure things were done correctly and give yourself a pat on the back for the progress!
