## Running Your First Docker Container

Ready to dive into the world of Docker? We're going to start by running our very first container.

By executing the following command in your terminal, you'll start a Docker container using the hello-world image:

```Bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command will automatically pull the hello-world image if not already available, create a container, and display a message confirming successful execution.

After running the command, click `Submit` to test your work and confirm everything is correct. ðŸš€
