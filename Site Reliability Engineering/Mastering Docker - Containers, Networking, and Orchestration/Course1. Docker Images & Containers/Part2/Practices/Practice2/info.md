## Create a Named Container

Let's continue building on what you've learned by creating a container using the nginx image.

There's no need to pull the image this time, as we've already done it for you. Your task is to create a container named `my-nginx` using the command:

```Bash
docker create --name my-nginx nginx
```

Once you create the named container, click `Submit` to test your actions and confirm the task completion.
