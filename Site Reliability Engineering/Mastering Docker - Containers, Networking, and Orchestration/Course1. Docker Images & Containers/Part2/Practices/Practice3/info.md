## Start a Pre-Created Container

Next, let's build on what we've already set up by starting a container that's ready for action.

To start the pre-created Docker container named `my-nginx`, execute the command:

```Bash
docker start my-nginx
```

This command will activate the `my-nginx` container and run it in the background.

Once you've completed these steps, click `Submit` to test your setup and finalize your effort.
