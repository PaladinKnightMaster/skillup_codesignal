## Identically Map Host and Container Ports

This time, let's try running your containerized application with ports mapped identically on both the host and the container.

We've already built the `custom-nginx image` for you. Your job is to run the container, mapping the following ports:

- Container port: **80**
- Host port: **80**

After executing the command, hit the `Submit` button and we'll verify if your application is accessible at `http://localhost:80`.
