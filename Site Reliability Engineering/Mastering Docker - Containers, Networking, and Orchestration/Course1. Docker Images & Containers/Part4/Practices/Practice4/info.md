## Expose and Map Ports in Docker

You're on a roll! Now, let's expand on what you've learned by correctly adding the `EXPOSE` directive to the Dockerfile and setting up specific port mapping for the container.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Insert the `EXPOSE` directive with port 8080 into the Dockerfile.
2. Build the Docker image.
3. Run the container with container port **8080** mapped to host port 80.

Keep up the fantastic work â€” you're making excellent progress!
