## Creating Your First Docker Volume

Congratulations on making it this far! Let's proceed by creating your first named volume in Docker.

To begin, use the following command, replacing `<volume_name>` with your preferred volume name:

```Bash
docker volume create <volume_name>
```

This will generate a Docker-managed named volume with the specific name you choose.

After executing the command, press `Submit` to verify the creation of your volume and complete the task.

Enjoy exploring how Docker simplifies data management! ðŸš€
