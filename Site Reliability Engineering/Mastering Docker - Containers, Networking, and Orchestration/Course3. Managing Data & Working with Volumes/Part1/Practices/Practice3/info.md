## Using Docker Volumes Efficiently

It's time to apply what you've learned about Docker volumes. Let's dive into this exercise and practice both creating a volume and attaching it to a container.

1. First, create a named volume called `data-hub`.

2. Next, run an `ubuntu` container and use `data-hub` attached to the `/app` directory with a container named `code-runner`:

After completing these steps, click the `Submit` button. We'll verify if the named volume is created, attached to a container, and listed correctly.

You're learning a lot; keep pushing forward!
