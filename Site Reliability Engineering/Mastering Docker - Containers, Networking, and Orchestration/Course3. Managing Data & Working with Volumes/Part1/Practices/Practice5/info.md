## Sharing Volumes Between Containers

You've been doing fantastic! Let's build on what you've learned and focus on sharing volumes between containers.

Here's your task:

1. **Create** a named volume called `shared-data`.

2. **Start** the first `ubuntu` container named `container1`. Mount the `shared-data` volume at the `/data1` directory.

3. **Launch** the second `ubuntu` container named `container2`. Mount the same `shared-data` volume at the `/data2` directory.

When you click the `Submit` button, we'll test if the volume is created and check if both containers are using it correctly.

Keep it up; you're on the right track!
