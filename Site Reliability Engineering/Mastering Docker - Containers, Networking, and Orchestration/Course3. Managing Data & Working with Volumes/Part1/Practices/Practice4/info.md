## Docker Automatic Volume Creation

Let's see Docker's automatic capabilities in action by handling volume creation seamlessly for us.

Here's what you'll do in this task:

1. List all Docker volumes to verify there are no existing volumes in this task.

2. Run an `ubuntu` container with the named volume `auto-volume`, and attach it to the `/auto` directory inside the container. Don't worry about creating `auto-volume` first; Docker will handle this for you.

3. List all Docker volumes again to ensure that the `auto-volume` is present.

When you hit the `Submit` button, we'll test if `auto-volume` was created and is being used by your container. Keep pushing forward; you're on the path to mastery! ðŸš€
