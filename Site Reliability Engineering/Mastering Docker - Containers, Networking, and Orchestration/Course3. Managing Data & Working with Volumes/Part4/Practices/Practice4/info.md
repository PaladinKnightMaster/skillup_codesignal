## Prune All Unused Docker Volumes

Let's continue by enhancing your skills in Docker volume management.

Your next task is to use the `docker volume prune -a` command to clean up all unused volumes in the environment.

In the current setup, there are:

- Two unused anonymous volumes.
- Two unused named volumes.
- One named volume currently in use.

After pruning all unused volumes, click the Submit button to test whether only the in-use volume remain after cleanup.

Mastering this will help you maintain an efficient setup. You're one step closer to becoming proficient â€” keep up the momentum!
