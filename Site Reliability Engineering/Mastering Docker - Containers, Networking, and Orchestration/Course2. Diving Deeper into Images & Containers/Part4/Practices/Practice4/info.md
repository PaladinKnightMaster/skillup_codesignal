## Master Management with Pruning

You've come a long way! Let's practice how to manage containers from stopping them to pruning unused resources to keep everything neat.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Use the appropriate Docker command to display all running containers.
2. Stop the two running containers by using their container IDs or names with the Docker stop command.
3. Use the Docker prune command to remove all stopped containers and free up resources.
4. Execute the Docker command to prune all unused images and clean up space.

After completing these steps, click `Submit` to check if all stopped containers and unused images have been removed to complete the task.
