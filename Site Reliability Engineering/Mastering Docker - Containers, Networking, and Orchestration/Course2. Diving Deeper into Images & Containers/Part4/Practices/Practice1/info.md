## Clean Up Stopped Containers Efficiently

Excellent progress so far! Let's continue by learning how to prune stopped containers and keep our Docker environment clean.

There are already 4 stopped containers in our environment. Your task is to remove all stopped containers using this command:

```Bash
docker container prune
```

When prompted, type `y` to confirm the removal.

After you've run the command, click the `Submit` button to check if the containers have been successfully removed and evaluate your task completion. Keep the momentum going!
