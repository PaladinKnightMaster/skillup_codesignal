## Prune Unused Docker Images Efficiently

You've been doing well with Docker cleanup. Now, let's focus on pruning unused images to free up space.

In this task there is a `hello-world` image that is not being used by any container. Here's what you need to do:

- Use the `docker image prune `-a command to remove all unused images.
- When prompted, type y to confirm the removal of these images.

After running the command, click the `Submit` button to verify that the images have been successfully pruned and submit your work.

Keep up the efficient management of your Docker resources!
