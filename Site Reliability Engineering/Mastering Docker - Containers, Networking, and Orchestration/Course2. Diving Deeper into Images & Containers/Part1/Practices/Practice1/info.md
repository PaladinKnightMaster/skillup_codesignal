## Running a Container in Interactive Mode

Let's dive into a hands-on practice with interactive mode. 🐋

Run a new Ubuntu container named `my-ubuntu` in interactive mode using the command:

```Bash
docker run -it --name my-ubuntu ubuntu
```

Once you run the command, you'll see a prompt indicating you're inside the container's shell.

Please leave the container running and click `Submit` so we can verify the container's interactive mode and evaluate your work.
