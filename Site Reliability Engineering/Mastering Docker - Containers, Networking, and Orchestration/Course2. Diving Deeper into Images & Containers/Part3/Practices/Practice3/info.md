## Comparing Container Removal Methods

You’ve been learning valuable skills! Let's apply them by managing two `nginx` containers to observe the difference when using the `--rm` option.

Here's your task:

1. Run an `nginx` container with automatic removal enabled, then stop it using `Ctrl+C`.

2. Run another `nginx` container without automatic removal and stop it as well.

When you click the `Submit` button, we’ll list all containers to see if the first one has been removed and if the second one still exists.
