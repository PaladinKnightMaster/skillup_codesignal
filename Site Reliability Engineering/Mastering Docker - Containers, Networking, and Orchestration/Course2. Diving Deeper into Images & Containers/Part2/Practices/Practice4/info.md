## Removing an Image Used By a Running Container

Nice work so far! Let's test your Docker skills with a practical scenario. Suppose you want to delete an image, but a running container is using it. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Stop the Running Container**: First, stop the active container named `ubuntu-container`.

2. **Remove the Container**: Next, remove the stopped container.

3. **Remove the Image**: Finally, delete the `ubuntu` image.

These steps will help improve your efficiency by ensuring no running containers depend on the image you wish to remove. ðŸš€
