Here's what you need to do:

1. **Identify the Stopped Container**: Use the following command to list all containers and find the stopped container named `ubuntu-container`:

```Bash
docker ps -a
```

2. **Remove the Stopped Container**: Execute the following command to remove it from your environment:

```Bash
docker rm ubuntu-container
```

When you click `Submit`, we'll check to ensure the `ubuntu-container` has been successfully removed and confirm your success.
