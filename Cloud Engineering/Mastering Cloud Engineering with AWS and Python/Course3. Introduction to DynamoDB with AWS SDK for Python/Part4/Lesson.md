# Mastering Data Retrieval in DynamoDB: GetItem and BatchGetItem

## Introduction and Context Recap
Welcome back! Having previously set up and configured tables in DynamoDB using Python's Boto3 library, today we focus on retrieving data from these tables. Retrieving data is crucial for any database system as it allows us to access and utilize stored data effectively. In this lesson, we concentrate on two pivotal operations—`GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`. Both are essential for efficient data retrieval, whether you're pulling a single item or multiple items based on their keys. By the end of this session, you'll be well-equipped to handle data retrieval tasks in DynamoDB proficiently.

## Reading Data with "GetItem"
Retrieving data from a DynamoDB table is straightforward when you have the full primary key of the item you're interested in. Let's say we need details for 'The Big New Movie' released in 2016 from our `Movies` table, where `year` and `title` make up the primary key.

For a simple read, you can retrieve the item like this:

```Python
# Simple read
result = table.get_item(Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'})
if 'Item' in result:
    print("Movie found:", result['Item'])
else:
    print("Movie not found.")
```
If you only need certain attributes, you can specify them using the `ProjectionExpression` parameter:

```Python
# Attributes projection
result = table.get_item(
    Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},
    ProjectionExpression='title, genre',
)
if 'Item' in result:
    print("Projected attributes of the movie:", result['Item'])
```
For a strongly consistent read, add the `ConsistentRead` parameter:

```Python
# Strongly consistent read
result = table.get_item(
    Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},
    ConsistentRead=True
)
if 'Item' in result:
    print("Consistently read movie details:", result['Item'])
```

## Retrieving Multiple Items with BatchGetItem
For fetching several items known by their primary keys, DynamoDB provides the `BatchGetItem` API. This operation is different from `GetItem`, as it retrieves more than one item at a time from a table. When using `BatchGetItem`, you'll need to specify the full primary key for each item—this means both the partition key and sort key if the table has a composite primary key. Here’s an example of how to retrieve multiple items using their full primary keys:

```Python
response = dynamodb.batch_get_item(
    RequestItems={
        'Movies': {
            'Keys': [
                {'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},  # Full primary key (partition key and sort key)
                {'year': 2017, 'title': 'The Bigger, Newer Movie'}  # Full primary key
            ],
            'ConsistentRead': True
        }
    }
)
```
In the above snippet, each dictionary in the `Keys` array contains a complete primary key that identifies a unique item in the `Movies` table. Specifying the full primary key in your `BatchGetItem` request ensures precise and efficient retrieval of the items you need.

While `BatchGetItem` is a powerful tool for retrieving multiple items at once, it comes with several limitations:

* **Maximum Items**: You can fetch up to 25 items in a single batch request.
* **Maximum Data Retrieval**: The total amount of data retrieved in a single batch operation cannot exceed 16 MB.
* **Unprocessed Keys**: If any part of your batch request cannot be processed due to capacity unit limitations or internal server errors, those items are returned in the `UnprocessedKeys` response. You need to handle these cases by retrying the failed requests.
* **Capacity Unit Consumption**: Each item read in the batch consumes read capacity units (RCUs). When specifying `ConsistentRead` as `True`, the operation consumes twice the standard RCU for each item.
These limitations require careful planning when implementing batch operations to ensure efficient usage of DynamoDB's resources and handling potential partial failures in batch requests.

## Handling Reserved Words in DynamoDB Expressions
When working with DynamoDB, certain attribute names may coincide with reserved words used by the service. Using these reserved words directly in expressions for operations like `GetItem` can cause errors. To circumvent this issue, you can use aliases defined in an `ExpressionAttributeNames` map along with a `ProjectionExpression` to specify the attributes you want to retrieve. This approach allows you to safely use reserved words in your DynamoDB operations.

Here's how you can handle reserved words in DynamoDB expressions by combining `ExpressionAttributeNames` with a `ProjectionExpression`:

```Python
result = table.get_item(
    Key={'year': 2021, 'title': 'Example Movie'},
    ProjectionExpression='#yr, title',
    ExpressionAttributeNames={'#yr': 'year'}
)
if 'Item' in result:
    print("Movie found with reserved word attribute:", result['Item'])
else:
    print("Movie not found.")
```
Some common reserved words that often require aliasing in DynamoDB include attributes like `Year`, `Date`, `Total`, `Order`, and `Status`. By aliasing these words, you can use them freely in your queries without encountering syntax errors. This practice ensures your database queries are robust and error-free.
