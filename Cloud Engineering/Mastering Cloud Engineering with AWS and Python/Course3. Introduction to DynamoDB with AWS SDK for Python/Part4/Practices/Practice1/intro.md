# Running Scripts and Manipulating DynamoDB Tables

In this task, you are required to run an existing Python script that will create a table named `Movies` in DynamoDB and populate it with several movie records. Furthermore, the script will retrieve and print specific items from the `Movies` table. Your primary task is to evaluate the output generated by running the script and understand the workflow of creating a table, adding items to it, and retrieving these items using various methods. No additional modifications or coding are required from you; all you need to do is run the script and comprehend how it operates.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
