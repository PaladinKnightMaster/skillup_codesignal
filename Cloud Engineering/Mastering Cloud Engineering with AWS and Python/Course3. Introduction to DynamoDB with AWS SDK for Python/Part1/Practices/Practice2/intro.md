# Switch to Default DynamoDB Session

For this task, we're going to deepen our understanding of AWS DynamoDB by altering some code. Currently, the provided script uses hardcoded access credentials to establish a session with AWS. As this is generally not considered good practice in terms of security, your task will be to adapt the code to use a default AWS session instead. Modify the code in the starter prompt accordingly and re-run the script.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the **reset button** located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
