# Initiating DynamoDB with Boto3 in Python

Welcome to a hands-on experience with DynamoDB and Boto3. In this initial exercise, you won't need to write any code. Instead, you will run a Python script that creates an AWS session with predefined credentials, a DynamoDB client, and a resource. This will give you a feel for the steps involved in initializing a DynamoDB connection in a Boto3 session from within a Python environment.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
