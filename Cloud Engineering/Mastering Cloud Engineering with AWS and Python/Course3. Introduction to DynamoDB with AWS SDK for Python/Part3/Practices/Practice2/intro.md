# Modifying Data in a DynamoDB Table

Great job! This time, we are refining our interaction skills with AWS DynamoDB. Before running the provided Python script, you are tasked with modifying it. Specifically, you need to update the `Students` table that we've been working with by modifying the attributes of a particular student record. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

1. Change the name attribute from `John Doe` to `John Smith` for the student with `student_id` of `1`.
2. Add a new attribute `email` with the value `john.smith@example.com` for the same student record.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
