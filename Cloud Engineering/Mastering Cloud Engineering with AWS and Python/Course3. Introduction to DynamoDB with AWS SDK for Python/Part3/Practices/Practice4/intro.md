# Batch Writing Items into a DynamoDB Table

Great progress! Now that you're familiar with DynamoDB basics, it's time to dive into a practical coding exercise. In this task, we have pre-provided a script for you. Initially, this script sets up a DynamoDB table named `Students`. Following the table creation, your primary task is to utilize the `batch_writer()` function to add three student records simultaneously. Each record should contain the attributes: `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `major`.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
