# Running DynamoDB Operations in Python

Welcome to your first task on data insertion in DynamoDB! Your task involves running a given script that not only creates a DynamoDB table named `Students` but also populates it with records for three students. After setting up the table with `student_id` as the primary key, the script will add student records, each including attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `major`.

Remember, no coding is required for this task. You'll simply run the given script and observe the changes in the DynamoDB table.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
