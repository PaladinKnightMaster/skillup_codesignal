# Adding a New Record to DynamoDB Table

In the following task, you are now asked to take a step further and interact with the `Students` DynamoDB table you created earlier. Your goal for this task is to add one more student record to the table. Begin by reviewing the provided script, and when you're ready, fill in the **TODO** line of code with a new student record, adding another student named `Emily Johnson` with the details `student_id: 2`, `name: 'Emily Johnson'`, `age: 22`, and `major: 'Data Science'` to the `Students` table.

Please ensure your script runs without errors and successfully populates the database with the new record.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. Keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
