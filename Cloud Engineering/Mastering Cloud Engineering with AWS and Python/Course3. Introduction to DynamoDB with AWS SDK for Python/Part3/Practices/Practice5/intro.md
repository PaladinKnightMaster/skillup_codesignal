# Mastering AWS DynamoDB with Python

This is the final task for this lesson! You've been doing great so far, and now it's time to put everything together. In this exercise, you are tasked with interacting with an existing **AWS DynamoDB** table named `Students`, which already has `student_id` as the primary key. Populate this table with a few records, ensuring each record includes `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `major`. Utilize conditional expressions to prevent overwriting existing records. Lastly, query and print all items from the `Students` table.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
