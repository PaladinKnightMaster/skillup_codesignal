# Mastering Deletion Operations in DynamoDB

Continue your journey with DynamoDB by mastering item deletion techniques. In this task, you are provided with a Python script that initializes a DynamoDB table named `UserPosts` and populates it with initial entries. Your challenge is to demonstrate your ability to delete items from this table effectively. You are expected to delete a single item specifically and then perform a batch delete operation to remove multiple items at once. This exercise will solidify your understanding of different deletion strategies in DynamoDB.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
