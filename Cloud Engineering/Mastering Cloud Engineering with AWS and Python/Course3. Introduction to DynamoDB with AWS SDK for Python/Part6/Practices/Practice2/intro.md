# Refining DynamoDB Queries for Specific Data

Great progress on your DynamoDB journey! This exercise introduces you to `KeyConditionExpression`, a means to construct key conditions for a DynamoDB `Query` operation. You will use Python script that initializes a DynamoDB table `Movies` and populates it with movie records.

Your task involves modifying an existing query. Initially, it fetches movies from a specific year. Adjust it to retrieve only the movies from **2016** with titles starting with `"The"`. This modification will showcase the power and flexibility of key conditions in narrowing down search results.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can lead to alterations in our AWS simulator resources. To return to the starting state, use the reset button in the top right corner. Be aware, resetting will erase any code changes. To safeguard your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
