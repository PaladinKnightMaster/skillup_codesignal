# Writing Query Commands in DynamoDB

You are progressing well on your DynamoDB journey! For this task, you are provided with a Python script that initializes a DynamoDB table named `Movies` and populates it with several movie records. Each record includes a `year` and `title` attribute, with year serving as the primary key. Your task is to extend the script by writing two `Query` operations:

1. Retrieve all movies released in the year **2018**.
2. Retrieve all movies from **2017** that have the title starting with "The".

This exercise aims to enhance your ability to construct and execute `Query` operations, a crucial skill for efficiently retrieving specific data sets from DynamoDB.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
