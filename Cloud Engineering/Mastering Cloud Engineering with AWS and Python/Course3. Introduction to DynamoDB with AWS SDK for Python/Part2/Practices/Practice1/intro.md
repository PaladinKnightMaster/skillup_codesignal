# Creating a DynamoDB Table with Boto3

As a first step into **DynamoDB**, you are tasked with reading the provided Python script. This script uses the Python SDK `Boto3` to interact with DynamoDB and to create a table named `Users`. Additionally, the script utilizes the resource interface of `Boto3` to create the DynamoDB table and employs the `wait_until_exists` method without parameters to pause execution until the table is ready. No coding is required for this task; simply review the script, understand its functionality, and then execute it.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
