# Enabling S3 Bucket Versioning

Excellent work, Space Explorer! Now, it's time to solidify your understanding of **S3 versioning**. Your space mission depends on mastering data version control for efficient archiving in the cloud. Can you enable versioning on a bucket? This is a crucial step to ensure that every version of your data is secured and retrievable.

**Important Note**: Running scripts might alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, remember that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
