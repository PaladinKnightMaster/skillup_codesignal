# Implementing File Version Control in AWS S3

Greetings, Space Voyager! As you have successfully enabled versioning on a bucket in the previous task, it's now time to suspend versioning for a bucket. Being able to suspend versioning is crucial for managing costs, as versioning stores all versions of an object, including all writes and deletes. Let's put your skills to the test, shall we?

Important Note: Keep in mind that running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, be aware that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
