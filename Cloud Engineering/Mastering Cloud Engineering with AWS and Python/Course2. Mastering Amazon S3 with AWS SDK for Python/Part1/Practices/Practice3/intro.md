# Creating an AWS Session and S3 Resource and Client

In this task, you will gain familiarity with establishing an AWS session and creating S3 resources and clients. This understanding will help set the foundation for further AWS-related tasks.

This task entails:

1. Creating an AWS session with specific, provided credentials.
2. Utilizing the session to create an S3 resource and client.

To achieve these tasks, fill in the TODO sections in the starting code.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
