# Add Intergalactic Data Archive Buckets Using Boto3

Well done on your journey through the cosmos of S3 buckets with **Boto3**! Now, let's test your skills further. Create a new bucket specifically for storing archive data from European space missions in the `eu-central-1` region called `cosmo-uploads-archive-europe-2023`. Then, create another bucket `cosmo-uploads-archive-us-2023` for US space mission archives in the default `us-east-1` region. Good luck!

**Important Note**: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
