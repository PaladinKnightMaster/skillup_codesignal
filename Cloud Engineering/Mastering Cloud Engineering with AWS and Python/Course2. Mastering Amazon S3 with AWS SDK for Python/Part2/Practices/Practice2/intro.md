# Relocate Galactic Data Bucket to Optimize Network

Space Explorer, a critical observation was made during our code review process concerning the setup of our galactic data storage. The script intended to bolster our interstellar exploration data network lacks a crucial detail â€” it does not specify the correct region for the S3 bucket's creation. This oversight could significantly impact data access speeds for our West Coast space stations. Your urgent mission is to correct this by configuring the bucket to be explicitly created in the `'eu-central-1'` region. This change is pivotal for enhancing data retrieval performance across our network.

Important Note: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
