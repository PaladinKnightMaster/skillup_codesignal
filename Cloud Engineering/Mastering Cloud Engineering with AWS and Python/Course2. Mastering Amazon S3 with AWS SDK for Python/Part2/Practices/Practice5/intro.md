# Space Bucket Manager: Create, List, and Delete S3 Buckets with Boto3

Great job making it this far, Space Explorer! You've learned a lot about managing S3 buckets with Boto3. For your final mission, let's apply all that knowledge. You're tasked with creating two S3 buckets: `'intergalactic-archive-us'` in the default `us-east-1` region and `'intergalactic-archive-eu'` in the `eu-central-1` region. Then, list all your buckets to see your entire galactic collection. Conclude your mission by safely removing the `'intergalactic-archive-eu'` bucket.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
