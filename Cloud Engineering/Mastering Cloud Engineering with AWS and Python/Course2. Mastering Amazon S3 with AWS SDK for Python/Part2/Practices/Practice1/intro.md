# Managing Cloud Storage with Boto3 in Python

Embark on a journey through AWS S3, where you're tasked with organizing your cosmic voyage memories and data across the galaxy. In this scenario, you will create three S3 buckets located in different regions to store photos from your intergalactic travels in 2024, widget data, and document archives from 2020. Witness firsthand how to manage these buckets within AWS: you'll see the listing of all your created buckets, perform a deletion operation on one, and then observe the updated list of buckets.

Simply click `Run` to see these S3 operations in action, showcasing the ease and power of managing cloud storage with AWS. No coding is required on your part for this task; enjoy watching your galactic storage system come to life!

Important Note: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
