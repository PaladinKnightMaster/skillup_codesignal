# Understanding Boto3 Sessions

Discover the power of AWS sessions with `Boto3` by simply observing and running the provided code. This task walks you through three types of sessions: a default session that uses your environment's AWS setup, a custom session with specific credentials for enhanced security, and a region-specific session tailored for operations in a particular geographic area.

Click `Run` to explore how each session is configured and operates, gaining insights into the versatile session management capabilities of `Boto3`. This hands-on exploration emphasizes the importance of tailored sessions in secure and effective AWS resource management.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
