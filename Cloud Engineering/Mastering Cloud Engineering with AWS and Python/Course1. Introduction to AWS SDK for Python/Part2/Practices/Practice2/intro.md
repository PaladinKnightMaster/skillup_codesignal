# Add Custom Retry Strategy to Boto3 S3 Client

You've mastered the setup of a client with custom retry strategies in **Boto3**! Now, let's put your skills to the test. Configure a **Boto3 S3** client using a specific custom retry strategy: set the number of retries to `5` and use the `standard` retry mode.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
