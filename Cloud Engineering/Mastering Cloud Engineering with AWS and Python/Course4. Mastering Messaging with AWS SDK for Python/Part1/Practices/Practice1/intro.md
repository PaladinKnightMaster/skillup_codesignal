# Creating AWS Resources with Placeholders and LocalStack

Well done in getting this far! In this task, you will execute a given Python script which creates AWS resources and clients for SQS and SNS, using the `Boto3` library. The script includes creating a default SQS resource and client, a default SNS resource and client, and setting a specific AWS session with specified access key, secret key, and region.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top-right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
