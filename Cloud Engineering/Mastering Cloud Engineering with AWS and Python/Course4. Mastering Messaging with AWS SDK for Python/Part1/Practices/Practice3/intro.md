# Setting Up AWS Session and Services with Boto3

Great progress so far! In this task, you are given a Python script with an AWS session that has already been set up. This session configures the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS using a specific access key, secret key, and region. Your objective now is to leverage this session to create a Simple Queue Service (SQS) resource and a Simple Notification Service (SNS) client. Ensure the SQS resource and SNS client are configured to utilize the provided AWS session, effectively enabling your script to interact with these AWS services.

Remember, this hands-on practice allows you to apply what you've learned about Boto3 and its ability to manage AWS services programmatically.

**Important Note**: As with any operations affecting AWS resources through scripts, be mindful of the potential changes you are making. During your practices here, you can easily revert any modifications by using the provided reset functionality. Copying your code before resetting can help you avoid losing your work.
