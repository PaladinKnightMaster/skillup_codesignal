# Creating and Setting SNS Topic Using Python Boto3

Fantastic progress so far! In this culminating task of the section, you'll combine what you've learned about **AWS Simple Notification Services (SNS)** and write a Python script from scratch. Your script will create an SNS topic named `'MyTopic'`, retrieve its **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**, and then set a **Display Name** attribute for this created topic. The **Display Name** is an attribute that appears in the "From" field for notifications sent via email. Please remember to print out the **Topic ARN** and a success message after setting the **Display Name** attribute.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
