# Listing Topics in SNS with Pagination

Advancing even further, this task will test your skills in listing SNS topics using the Boto3 resource interface. A script is provided, which creates 15 SNS topics; however, the listing part of the script is incomplete. Your task is to fill in the missing code in order to list all the topics and print out their ARNs effectively.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
