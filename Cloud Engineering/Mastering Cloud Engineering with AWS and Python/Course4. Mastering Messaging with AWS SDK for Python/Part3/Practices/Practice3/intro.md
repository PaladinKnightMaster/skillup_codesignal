# Receiving And Deleting The Messages

In this task, you are given a script that interacts with an existing Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue called 'MyLearningQueue'. This queue contains motivational messages. Your task is to complete the script by adding functionality to receive a message from the queue, print the content of the message, and then delete it from the queue. Good luck!

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
