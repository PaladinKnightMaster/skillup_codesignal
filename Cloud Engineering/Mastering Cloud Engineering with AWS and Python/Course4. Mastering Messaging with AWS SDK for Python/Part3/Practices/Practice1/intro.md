# Running and Understanding SQS Operations

In this task, your goal is to run a pre-written Python script that employs AWS' Simple Queue Services (SQS) program. The script is designed to create both a standard and a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue, then dispatch, receive, and delete various messages within these queues. Make sure to examine the script's structure and commands before executing it for a better understanding of its procedures.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the `reset` button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
