# Subscribing SQS to an SNS Topic

In this task, you'll learn how to connect Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) to efficiently manage messaging. Given a Python script which creates an SQS queue and an SNS topic, your task is to complete the code by subscribing the created SQS queue to the SNS topic. Your solution code should contain the entire script, including the creation of the SQS queue, the SNS topic, and the added subscription.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
