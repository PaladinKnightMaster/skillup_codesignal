# Publishing and Receiving Messages with SNS and SQS

In this task, given a Python script where both Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) have been set up and the SQS queue has been subscribed to the SNS topic, your goal is to complete the remainder. You should publish a test message to the SNS topic and then confirm message delivery by receiving this message from the subscribed SQS queue. Your solution should include both of these operations.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
