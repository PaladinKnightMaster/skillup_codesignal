# Fixing FIFO Queue Creation

Welcome to this task! The existing Python script is designed to create a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue in Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS) but seemingly contains some errors preventing the queue from being created correctly. Your goal in this task is to sift through this script, identify the bug or bugs causing the problem, and fix them. After correcting the errors, run your updated script to verify the successful creation of the FIFO queue.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, remember that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to your clipboard.
