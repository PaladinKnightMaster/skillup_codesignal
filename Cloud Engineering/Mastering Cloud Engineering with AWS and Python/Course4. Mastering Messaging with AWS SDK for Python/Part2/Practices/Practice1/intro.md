# Creating a Simple SQS Queue

For this task, all you need to do is run the provided Python script that creates different types of Amazon SQS queues: a simple queue, a queue with various attributes, and a FIFO queue. No extra coding is required on your part. Your objective is to understand the process of creating queues with different configurations and to observe the differences in their respective URLs.

**Important Note**: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
