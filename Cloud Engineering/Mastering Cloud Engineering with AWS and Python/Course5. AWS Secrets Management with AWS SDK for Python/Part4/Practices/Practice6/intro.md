# Mastering AWS SSM Parameter Store Operations

For the final task of this section, you are required to implement a script from scratch that interacts with the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. This exercise will require you to apply all the concepts you've learned thus far to create, read, update, tag, and delete parameters, as well as work with parameter hierarchies. Go ahead, emit your knowledge vibe, and write your script!

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
