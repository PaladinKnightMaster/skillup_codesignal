# Creating and Fetching AWS SSM Parameters

Welcome to this task on managing AWS SSM Parameters! Your job is to modify the provided Python script to retrieve and print the values of the `/app_config/api_url` and `/app_config/api_key` parameters using the `get_parameter` method. Be sure to utilize the `WithDecryption` parameter correctly when fetching these values.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
