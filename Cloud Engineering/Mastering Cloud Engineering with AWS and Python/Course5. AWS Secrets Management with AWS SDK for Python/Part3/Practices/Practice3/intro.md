# Updating Secrets with Auto-Generated Passwords

Cosmo, our lovable CodeSignal Learn mascot, has a secret he wants to secure and ensure its safety. He decided to auto-generate a highly secure password. Your task is to update this password using AWS Secret Manager. Initially, you are given a script that creates a secret with a basic password. You need to modify the script to update the password with an auto-generated one.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
