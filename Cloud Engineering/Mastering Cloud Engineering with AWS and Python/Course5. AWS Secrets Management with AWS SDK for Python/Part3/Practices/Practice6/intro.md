# Restoring a Deleted Secret

Being a mascot is a tough job, and sometimes in the hustle and bustle, Cosmo can accidentally delete secrets he still needs. Luckily, deleted secrets are not immediately removed and can be restored within a certain time period. Faced with such a situation, your task is to help Cosmo out by completing a Python script that restores a secret that was just deleted.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
