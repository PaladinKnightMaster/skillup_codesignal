# Tagging Secrets with Creator Information

Our mascot, Cosmo, has many secrets he needs to manage! In this activity, you'll help him keep things organized by tagging his secrets. Initially, you're given a Python script that creates a secret. You need to add to this script and make it tag the secret, indicating that Cosmo is the creator. By tagging secrets, you can classify and manage them more efficiently, depending on your organizational needs.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
