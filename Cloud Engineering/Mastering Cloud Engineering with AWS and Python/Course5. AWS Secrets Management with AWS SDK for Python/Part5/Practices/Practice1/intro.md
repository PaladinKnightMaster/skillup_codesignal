# Creating a Customer Master Key in AWS KMS

As a precursor, you've acquired a solid understanding of how to manage keys in **AWS KMS** using **Python Boto3**. In this task, you will leverage this knowledge and put it into practice. Your mission is to run a provided Python script that creates an **AWS KMS key** using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**. While running the script, observe the output for a better understanding of how the key is created.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
