# Mastering Key Management in AWS KMS

This is your final challenge, where you will need your knowledge about **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** to complete the task. For this task, you are asked to write an entire Python script from scratch. The script needs to create an **AWS KMS key**, generate a data key, encrypt some sample data locally, describe the key created, list all keys, enable key rotation for the **AWS KMS key**, and finally, schedule the **AWS KMS key** for deletion. Run the script and observe the flow of the process to reinforce your understanding of **AWS KMS**.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
