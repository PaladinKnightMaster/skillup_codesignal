# Mastering AWS Secrets Manager: Write it all!

Now, it's time to put your **AWS Secrets Manager** skills to the test. In this task, you will write a complete **Python script** that creates, retrieves, updates (rotates), retrieves the updated secret, and finally retrieves the previous version of the secret. The goal of this task is to provide hands-on experience with the concepts you've learned so far in this lesson.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
