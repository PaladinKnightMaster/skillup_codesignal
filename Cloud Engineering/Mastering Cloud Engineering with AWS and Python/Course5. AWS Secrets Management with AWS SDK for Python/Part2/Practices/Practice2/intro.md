# Creating a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager Secret

A secret meeting is scheduled at CodeSignal Learn to discuss our learning impact strategy. To share the details of the event smartly and securely, we have decided to use **AWS Secrets Manager**. Your task is to write a script that creates a new secret named `"StrategyMeeting"` in AWS Secrets Manager. This secret should contain a `venue` and `date` attribute, having the values `"CodeSignal Office"` and `"Tomorrow"` respectively.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you may use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, remember that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
