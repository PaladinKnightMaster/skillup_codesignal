# Deleting a Secret

The surprise party that Cosmo invited us to went greatly! Now that it's over, let's ensure that the details of the special event remain a secret. Your mission is to complete the provided script by adding the necessary logic to delete the `"PartyDetails"` secret from the **AWS Secrets Manager**.

Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you may use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
