# Learn Multiple Renaming

Awesome work so far! Let's continue refining your skills with another practice exercise.

For this practice, you will need to perform multiple renamings simultaneously!

You need to:

1. Rename the `Age` column to `HeroAge`.
2. Rename the `Strength` column to `HeroStrength`.

Hint: The `rename` function can take multiple arguments to rename multiple columns at once!
