# Chaining Functions in dplyr

Great job so far! You've come a long way in practicing how to chain `dplyr` functions together.

This final task will test your knowledge by having you create a chained sequence of `dplyr` functions to manipulate a dataframe of superheroes.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Add a new column `PowerIndex`, which is `Strength` multiplied by 1.2.
2. Filter rows where `Age` is less than 40.
3. Select the columns `HeroName`, `Age`, `Strength`, and `PowerIndex`.
4. Arrange the rows by `Age` in ascending order.
5. Slice the first 3 rows.

You've got this!
