# Data Transformation and Positioning

Great job so far! Let's continue improving our data and adjusting the column positions.

Your task is to complete the given code to add new columns and change the order of these columns using the `mutate` and `relocate` functions from the `dplyr` package. Follow the TODOs in the starter code to complete this task.

Specifically, you will:

1. Add new columns `AgilityBoost` and `TotalStrength` to the dataframe.
2. Relocate the newly created `TotalStrength` column to appear immediately after the `Name` column.
