# Manipulate Data Frames from Scratch

You've made excellent progress in manipulating data frames! Now let's put everything together by writing some code from scratch. We'll be making a simple inventory management system!

Your task is to:

1. Create a data frame with columns `ID`, `Product`, and `Quantity`.
2. Add a new `Price` column.
3. Remove the `Quantity` column.
4. Decrease each value in the `Price` column by 5%.
5. Print the manipulated data frame.
