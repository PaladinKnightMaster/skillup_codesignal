# Fix the Bug in Data Frame

You've been doing great so far! Now, let's identify and fix several bugs. You are given a piece of `R` code that aims to create a data frame, add a new column, remove an existing column, and then manipulate the data.

- The code should create a data frame with columns `ID`, `Name`, and `Age`.
- It should then add a `Salary` column with specified values.
- The `Age` column should be removed from the data frame.
- Finally, the `Salary` values should be increased by 10%.

However, there are multiple mistakes in the code. Your task is to find and fix all the bugs.

Hint: Remember that R is case sensitive!
