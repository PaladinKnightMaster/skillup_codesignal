# Mean to Median

Great progress so far! Let's make a slight change to our existing data frame and see how it affects the cleaning process.

Currently, the code replaces `NA` values in the `Salary` column with the mean value of the column. Your task is to modify the code so that the missing values are replaced with the median (most common) value instead!

Hint: You can use the `median()` function for this!
