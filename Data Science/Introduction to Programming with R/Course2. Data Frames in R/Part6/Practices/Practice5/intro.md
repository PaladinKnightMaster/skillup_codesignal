# Mastering Data Cleaning in R

You're doing great! Let's put everything you've learned into practice. Your task is to identify and handle missing values (`NA`) in the `Rating` and `Duration` columns of a given data frame representing information about top movies.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Check for NA values.

2. Remove rows with NA values.

3. Replace NA values in the Rating column with the mean of the column, and do the same for the Duration column.

Remember, data cleaning is an important step in data analysis. Keep going, you're doing an awesome job!
