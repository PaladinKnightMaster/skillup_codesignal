# Aggregating Data in R

Great job following along so far! Before running the code, let's understand how the code works.

The code does the following:

1. **Creates a data frame** with details of some individuals, including their names, ages, and salaries.

    - We use the `data.frame` function to create a data frame with columns `ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `Salary`. Each column is populated with relevant data.

2. **Adds an `AgeGroup` column** to categorize individuals based on their age.

    - The `cut` function is used on the `Age` column to divide ages into specified intervals (20-29, 30-39, etc.). The `breaks` parameter specifies the intervals, and `right=FALSE` signifies that the intervals are left-closed (20 is included, 30 is not).\

3. **Calculates the average salary** by age group using the `aggregate` function and prints the result.

    - The `aggregate` function is utilized to compute the average salary for each age group. The formula `Salary ~ AgeGroup` indicates that Salary is being aggregated by AgeGroup. The `FUN=mean` parameter specifies that the mean function is used for aggregation.
    - The `sum` and `length` functions can similarly be used in place of `mean` to calculate the total salary and the count of individuals in each age group, respectively.
    - The result of the aggregation is printed to understand the average salaries for each age group.

Observe how the data is categorized and aggregated. This will help you understand and solve future tasks more effectively!
