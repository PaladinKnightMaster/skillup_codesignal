# Adding and Aggregating Columns

Great job so far! Let's take it a step further by adding more details to our data frame.

In this task, we will add a new `Position` column. This column will store the job positions of individuals such as 'Manager', 'Developer', and 'Analyst'.

After adding this column, the final code should group the ages and aggregate the data as before. Specifically, we will:

1. Add an `AgeGroup` column to categorize ages.
2. Calculate and print the average salary by age group.
3. Calculate and print the total salary by age group.

Follow the TODOs to fill in the placeholders and complete this task!
