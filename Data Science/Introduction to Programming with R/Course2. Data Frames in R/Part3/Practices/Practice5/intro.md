# Data Frame Operations From Scratch

Well done on the previous tasks! Now, let's put everything together and build a data frame from scratch.

Your task is to:

1. Create a data frame containing information about four superheroes with their `ID`, `Name`, and `Age`.

2. Filter and display rows for superheroes older than 1,000 years.

3. Filter and display rows for superheroes younger than 200 years.

4. Sort and display the data frame by `Age` in both ascending and descending order.
