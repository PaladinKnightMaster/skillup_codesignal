# Update Data Frame Values

Great work so far! The provided code initializes a data frame `df` with three columns: ID, Name, and Age. It then prints the entire data frame, accesses the 'Name' column, and accesses the second row.

The task is to modify the code so that it accesses the 'Age' column and accesses the third row instead.

Follow the TODOs for guidance!
