# Creating and Exploring Data Frames

You've been doing great so far! Now it's time to show that you've mastered creating and inspecting data frames in R.

Create a data frame named `star_wars_df` with three columns: `ID`, `Name`, and `Age`. Populate it with the following characters and their corresponding ages:

- Luke: 19
- Leia: 19
- Han: 32
- Obi-Wan: 57
- Yoda: 900

After creating the data frame, you should:

1. Display the entire data frame.
2. Access and display the `Name` column.
3. Access and display the second row.
