# Square Root Calculator

Great progress so far! Now, let's learn something new and exciting! Specifically, we'll focus on using the `sqrt` function and the `^` operator.

In R:
- `sqrt(x)` computes the square root of `x`.
- `y ^ n` raises `y` to the power of `n`.

Your task is to change the code to use the `^` operator instead of the `sqrt()` function.

For example, instead of using `sqrt(a)`, you can achieve the same result using `a^(1/2)`.

Make this change in the provided code.
