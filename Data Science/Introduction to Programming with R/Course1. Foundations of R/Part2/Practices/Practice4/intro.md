# Calculate the Circle's Area

Nice work on the previous tasks! In this one, let's add the missing parts to the provided R code to calculate the area of a circle. You will be assigning numeric variables, performing basic arithmetic operations, and using built-in mathematical functions.

Given the radius of a circle, the formula to calculate its area is:

Area = $ \pi \times r^2 $

Let me know if you'd like it formatted differently!


Use the value `3.14` as an approximation for `Pi`.

Note: Just as you've been comfortably assigning and using integers in your calculations, you can do the same with decimal numbers! Embrace the power of decimals, and watch how seamlessly they integrate into your R programming journey.
