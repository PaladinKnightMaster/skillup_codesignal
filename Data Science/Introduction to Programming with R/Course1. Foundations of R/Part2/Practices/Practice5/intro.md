# Calculate Hypotenuse and Area

You've done great so far! Now, let's put all your knowledge into action.

In this task, you need to calculate the **hypotenuse** and the **area** of a right triangle.

The formula to calculate the hypotenuse is:

**hypotenuse = √(a² + b²)**

The area of a right triangle is given by:

**area = (a × b) / 2**

The code should:

1. Assign values 3 and 4 to the sides `a` and `b` of the right triangle respectively.
2. Calculate the hypotenuse using the formula above.
3. Calculate the area of the triangle.
4. Print the hypotenuse and the area.

This is the last task of this Unit, so give it everything you've got! You're doing a fantastic job.
