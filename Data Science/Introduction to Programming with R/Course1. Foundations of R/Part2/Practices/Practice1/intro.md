# Performing Basic Arithmetics

Great job so far! Now, let's run a slightly modified version of the code you saw in the lesson and observe the output.

In this task, we will:

1. Assign numeric variables.
2. Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - Addition (`+`): Adds two numbers.
    - Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the second number from the first.
    - Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies two numbers.
    - Division (`/`): Divides the first number by the second.
    - Note: In `R`, division results in a floating-point number if the result is not an integer. For example, `10 / 3` results in approximately `3.333333`. If the division is exact, such as `10 / 2`, it will return `5` without a decimal point.
3. Print the results of these operations.

Running this code will help you understand how these concepts work in `R`.
