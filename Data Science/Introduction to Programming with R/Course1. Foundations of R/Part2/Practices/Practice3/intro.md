# Division Bug

Great job so far! You've explored basic numeric variables and arithmetic operations. Now, let's identify and fix a bug in the given `R` code. For this task, let's focus on the division operator!

The program is supposed to assign numeric variables, divide 50 by 10, and print the result 5. However there seems to be an error.

Can you identify and fix the bugs so that the program correctly prints 5 in the console?
