# Variance to Standard Deviation

Great job so far with learning how to calculate basic statistics. Let's make a small change to our existing code to deepen our understanding.

Before making any changes, however, let's learn about 2 more important statistical functions:

**Variance**: Measures how much the values in the dataset deviate from the mean, squared. Larger variances indicate that the values are spread out more.

```R
# Calculate the variance
variance_value <- var(numeric_vec)
```

**Standard Deviation**: Provides a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It is the square root of the variance.

```R
# Calculate the standard deviation
std_dev_value <- sd(numeric_vec)
```

For this Practice, instead of calculating the variance of a numeric vector, we'll calculate and print the standard deviation.

Make the necessary changes to the code to achieve this!
