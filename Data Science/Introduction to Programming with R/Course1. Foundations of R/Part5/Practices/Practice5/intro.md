# Statistics Challenge

You're doing great! In this final practice, let's put everything together.

Write an R script that:

1. Creates a numeric vector named `grades` with the values: `82`, `90`, `76`, `88`, `95`.
2. Calculates and prints the mean of the vector.
3. Calculates and prints the median of the vector.
4. Calculates and prints the variance of the vector.
5. Calculates and prints the standard deviation of the vector.
6. Finds and prints the minimum value of the vector.
7. Finds and prints the maximum value of the vector.
8. Calculates and prints the sum of the values in the vector.
