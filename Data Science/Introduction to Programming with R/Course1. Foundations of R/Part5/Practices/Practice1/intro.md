# Analyzing Monthly Revenue Statistics

Great job reaching the practice session! In this task, you'll work on analyzing monthly revenue statistics using R. This will help you understand how to use basic statistical functions.

Here's what we'll do:

1. **Create a Numeric Vector**: We'll start by creating a numeric vector.
2. **Calculate Basic Statistics**: We will calculate the mean, minimum, and maximum of the values in the vector.
3. **Calculate the Sum**: We will also calculate the sum of the values in the vector using the `sum()` function. `sum(x)` is used to add together all the elements in the vector `x`.

Remember, In R, functions are essential tools for simplifying complex operations and analyzing data. Simply run the code to see these functions in action!
