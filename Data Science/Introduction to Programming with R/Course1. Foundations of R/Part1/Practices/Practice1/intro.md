# Run Your First R Script

Welcome to your first Practice session!

Before running the code, let's understand how to assign a string to a variable and then print it.

**Key Points**:
- In R, the assignment operator `<-` is used to assign values to variables.
- The message (string) should be enclosed in double quotes `""`.
- The `print()` function is used to output the value of the variable to the Console.

Additionally comments are added using the `#` symbol. Everything following the `#` on the same line is ignored by R and is not executed as part of the script. Comments are useful for explaining what your code does, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand.

Now, let's run a code similar to the one you saw in the lesson. For this practice, we are going to assign a different string to a variable named `greeting` and print it.
