# Vector Operation Basics

Nice work modifying vectors! Now, let's practice adding missing parts to our code to reinforce your understanding.

Before writing any code, let's explore a new concept: performing operations on numeric vectors! Just as you can perform operations on individual numbers, you can also perform operations on entire vectors. Let's see how this is done:

- Adding a constant to each element of the vector:

```R
numeric_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
sum_vec <- numeric_vec + 2
# sum_vec will be c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
```

- Performing element-wise addition with another numeric vector:

```R
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vec2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
result_vec <- vec1 + vec2
# result_vec will be c(5, 7, 9)
```

- Multiplying each element by a constant:

```R
numeric_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
product_vec <- numeric_vec * 3
# product_vec will be c(3, 6, 9, 12, 15)
```

Now, fill in the missing parts to create numeric vectors, access specific elements, and perform operations on the numeric vectors.
