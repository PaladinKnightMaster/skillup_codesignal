# Mastering Vector Operations

Nice job on the previous tasks! Let's put it all together in this final practice of the Unit!

In this task, we'll simulate an inventory management system by working with vectors to store and manipulate product data. You need to:

- Create a numeric vector named `inventory_qty` that holds the quantities: `25, 50, 75, 100, 125`.
- Create a character vector named `products` that holds product names: `"Water Bottles"`, `"Soda Cans"`, `"Juice Boxes"`, `"Milk Cartons"`, and `"Coffee Cups"`.
- Print the `inventory_qty` vector.
- Print the `products` vector.
- Print the length of the `products` vector.
- Access and print the first element of the `inventory_qty` vector.
- Access and print the fourth and fifth elements of the `products` vector.
- Decrease each element in the `inventory_qty` vector by `5` and print the updated vector.
