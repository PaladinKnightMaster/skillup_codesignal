# Vector Access and Modification

Nice work so far! Now let's adjust the vector access code.

Currently, the code accesses the first element of `numeric_vec` and elements 2 to 4 of `char_vec`. Modify it to access the third element of `numeric_vec` and elements 1 to 3 of `char_vec`.

Additionally, let's learn something new and print the length of both vectors using the `length()` function!

The `length()` function in R returns the number of elements in a vector. For example:

```R
length(numeric_vec)  # Returns 5
```

Make the changes and pay attention to the new `length()` function as well!
