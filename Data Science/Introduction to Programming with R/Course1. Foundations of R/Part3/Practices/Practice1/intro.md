# Exploring Comparison Operators

Great job so far! Now, let's run the code from the lesson to see how comparison operators work in R.

Comparison operators let you compare values and return logical results (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). These operators are crucial for decision-making in your programs.

Here are the comparison operators used in R:

- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

We will assign numeric values to the variables `a` and `b`, and use different comparison operators to see the results.
