# Comparing Director Names

Nice work so far! For this task, let's learn a new concept by comparing strings.

Just like with numbers, the `==` and `!=` operators can be used to compare texts for equality and inequality. When comparing two strings using `==`, it checks if the strings are exactly identical. Similarly, `!=` checks if the strings are not the same.

For example:

```R
name1 <- "Alice"
name2 <- "Bob"

is_equal <- name1 == name2   # This will be FALSE because "Alice" is not equal to "Bob"
is_not_equal <- name1 != name2  # This will be TRUE because "Alice" is not equal to "Bob"
```

In this task you will complete the provided R script to compare the names of the directors to see if they are the same or different!
