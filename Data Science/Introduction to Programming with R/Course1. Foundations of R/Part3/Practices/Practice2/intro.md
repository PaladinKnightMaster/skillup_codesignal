# Comparison Challenge: Movie Lengths

Great job so far! Now, let's modify the existing code to compare the lengths of two movies.

The lengths in minutes are:

- Movie A: `120`
- Movie B: `150`

Change the given code to use the `>` comparison operator to check if Movie A is longer than Movie B, and print the result.
