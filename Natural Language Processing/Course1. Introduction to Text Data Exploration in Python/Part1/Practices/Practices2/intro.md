# Expanding Data Preview with Python

Building on your journey through data exploration, you've learned to load the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset and inspect its initial entries using the `head()` method.

Now, let's tweak the way we preview data. Moving beyond the default settings, this practice requires you to change the number of displayed rows when using the `head()` method. Instead of the default first five entries, adjust the code to display the first 10 entries. This small yet practical adjustment will familiarize you with customizing data previews, a handy skill for any data exploration task.
