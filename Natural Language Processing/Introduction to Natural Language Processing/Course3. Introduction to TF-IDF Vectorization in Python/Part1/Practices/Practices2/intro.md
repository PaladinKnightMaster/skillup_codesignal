# Debugging TF-IDF Vectorization

In this practice, you are tasked with correcting a snippet of code designed to transform SMS messages into TF-IDF vectors. Although the code nearly achieves its goal, it falls short due to a few bugs.

Your objective is to meticulously examine, identify these inaccuracies, and apply your knowledge to repair the script, ensuring its successful execution of the vectorization as intended. This exercise underscores the importance of attention to detailâ€”a critical skill in preprocessing text data for machine learning.
