# Debugging the TF-IDF Vectorizer

In this task, you'll troubleshoot a piece of code intended to identify the **top 10** TF-IDF features from a dataset. Despite its aim, the code currently falls short due to a bug. Your challenge is to debug the Python code. Pay close attention to syntax and function utilization. Correcting this issue will not only solidify your grasp on TF-IDF vectorization but also prime you for more complex text analysis tasks ahead.
