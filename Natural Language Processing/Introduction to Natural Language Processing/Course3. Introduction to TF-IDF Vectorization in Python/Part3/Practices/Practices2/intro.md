# Updating TF-IDF Parameters for Text Vectorization

Splendid work, Space Explorer! Now, let's tweak the existing text vectorization. Update the parameters for `TfidfVectorizer`, setting the `ngram_range` to `(1, 3)` to include trigrams and adjusting the `max_features` to `500`. Run your updated code, and note the changes in the shape of your feature matrix output!
