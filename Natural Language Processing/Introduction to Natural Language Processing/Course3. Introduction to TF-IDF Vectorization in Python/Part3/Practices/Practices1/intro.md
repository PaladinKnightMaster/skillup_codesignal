# Customized TF-IDF Vectorization Parameters

In this task, we'll observe the use of `ngram_range` as (1, 2) and `max_features` as 1000 in our TF-IDF vectorization on the SMS Spam Collection dataset to refine the feature matrix. Explore the impact on the feature matrix's structure by executing the provided code. No code modifications are required; simply press `Run` to see the results.
