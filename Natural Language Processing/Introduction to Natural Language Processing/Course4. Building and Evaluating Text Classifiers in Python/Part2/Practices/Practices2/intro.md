# Debugging Logistic Regression Model

Following our advancements in applying logistic regression for text classification, this exercise introduces a debugging challenge to solidify your understanding of the workflow and common pitfalls. You'll be working with Python code that attempts to classify text messages as **spam** or **not**, using logistic regression. However, there's an error preventing the code from executing correctly. Your task is to identify and correct this error, enhancing your debugging skills and reinforcing your knowledge of the logistic regression implementation.
