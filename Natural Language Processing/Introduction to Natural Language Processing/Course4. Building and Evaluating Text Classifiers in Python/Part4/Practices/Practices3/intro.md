# Debugging Grid Search Implementation

In this task you'll debug a Python script meant for fine-tuning a Naive Bayes classifier with Grid Search on the SMS Spam Collection dataset. A small bug in the code prevents the Grid Search from executing correctly. Your task is to identify and fix this error to ensure the optimal `alpha` parameter for the classifier can be accurately determined.
