# Elevating Cross-Validation to 10-Folds

Continuing from your successful journey through the basics of cross-validation, we delve deeper into refining your skills. We have discovered how 5-fold cross-validation provides a dependable metric of our model's performance. Now, we will tweak this setting to deepen our understanding.

Change the `cv` parameter in `cross_val_score()` from a 5-fold to a 10-fold cross-validation. This shift is crucial for observing how the increase in folds influences the robustness and reliability of our model evaluation, laying the groundwork for informed decisions on model training and validation techniques.
