# Implementing Cross-Validation in Python

Building on the solid foundation you've developed from understanding cross-validation, we're diving a bit deeper. You'll fill in the gaps in a Python script designed to perform 5-fold cross-validation on a Naive Bayes classifier, targeting the detection of spam messages.

This task emphasizes honing your ability to apply the `cross_val_score` function from the `sklearn` library, ensuring you can accurately assess a model's performance across different data splits. Remember, correctly implementing cross-validation is key to validating the stability and reliability of your machine learning model.
