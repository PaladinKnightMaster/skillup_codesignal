# Adding Nested Relationships in GraphQL

In this task, you will enhance the provided GraphQL schema by adding a `Publisher` type. The `Publisher` should have fields like `id`, `name`, and a list of `books` it publishes. Update the sample data accordingly and ensure the resolvers correctly handle this new nested relationship.

Finally, verify your changes by running the server and querying for publishers and their books. This task will solidify your understanding of how to add nested entities to a GraphQL schema and how to handle their relationships.
