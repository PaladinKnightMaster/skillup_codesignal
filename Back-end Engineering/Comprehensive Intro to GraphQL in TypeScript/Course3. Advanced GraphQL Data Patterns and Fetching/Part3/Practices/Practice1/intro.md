# Enhancing GraphQL with Filtering

In this task, you'll improve your skills by updating an existing GraphQL schema and resolver. The provided script sets up a basic structure for querying books with optional filtering by genre or author. Your task is to add an additional optional argument to the `books` query: `publishedDate`. Ensure the resolver can handle filtering based on this new argument when it is provided.
