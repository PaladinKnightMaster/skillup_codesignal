# Using Data Loaders to Avoid N+1 Problem

## Introduction to the N+1 Problem and Data Loaders
In this lesson, weâ€™re going to address a common performance issue in **GraphQL** known as the **N+1** problem and how to solve it using **Data Loaders**.

The N+1 problem occurs when your GraphQL server makes an excessive number of database or API calls to satisfy nested queries. For example, if you fetch a list of books along with their authors, your server might make one query to get the books (1 query) and then one additional query per book to get the author (N queries), leading to a total of N+1 queries. This can significantly degrade the performance of your application.

Data Loaders help to batch and cache the requests, effectively reducing the number of queries made and improving the performance.

Benefits of Using Data Loaders:

* **Batching**: Combines multiple requests into a single batch query.
* **Caching**: Reduces redundant queries by remembering previously fetched results.

## Defining the GraphQL Schema
In GraphQL, the schema defines the shape of the data and the queries you can perform. To illustrate how Data Loaders can solve the N+1 problem, weâ€™ll create a simple GraphQL schema with authors and books.

Hereâ€™s how you can define the schema:

```TypeScript
import { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server';

// Sample data
const authors = [
  { id: '1', name: 'J.R.R. Tolkien' },
  { id: '2', name: 'J.K. Rowling' }
];
const books = [
  { id: '1', title: 'The Hobbit', author: '1' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Harry Potter', author: '2' }
];

// Define schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Author {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }

  type Book {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: Author
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
    author(id: ID!): Author
  }
`;
```

In this schema:

* We define `Author` and `Book` types.
* The `Book` type has a nested `Author` type.
* The `Query` type fetches a list of books and a single author by ID.

## Implementing Resolvers with Data Loaders
Data Loaders serve two primary functions: batching and caching requests.

1. **Batching**: Data Loaders collect multiple requests made in a single event loop tick and combine them into a single query, reducing the total number of database/API calls.
2. **Caching**: Once a piece of data is fetched, Data Loaders cache the result. If the same data is requested again, the Data Loader returns the cached value instead of making another request.

Before implementing the resolvers, we need to initialize a Data Loader for batching and caching authors:

```TypeScript
import DataLoader from 'dataloader';

// Initialize dataloader
const authorLoader = new DataLoader(async (ids: readonly string[]) => {
  return ids.map(id => authors.find(author => author.id === id) as typeof authors[0]);
});
```

Hereâ€™s how you can implement resolvers using Data Loaders:

```TypeScript
// Resolvers
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
    author: async (_: unknown, { id }: { id: string }, { authorLoader }: { authorLoader: DataLoader<string, typeof authors[0]> }) => authorLoader.load(id)
  },
  Book: {
    author: async (book: { author: string }, _: unknown, { authorLoader }: { authorLoader: DataLoader<string, typeof authors[0]> }) => {
      return authorLoader.load(book.author)
    }
  }
};
```

In this example:

* **Query Resolvers**:
  * `books` returns all books directly.
  * `author` uses `authorLoader.load(id)` to fetch an author by ID. The Data Loader batches requests made within the same event loop tick and caches the results.
* **Nested Resolver**:
  * The `author` field within the `Book` type uses `authorLoader.load(book.author)` to retrieve the author, leveraging Data Loader's batching and caching capabilities.

## Initializing and Using Data Loaders
Now, letâ€™s integrate the initialized Data Loader into our Apollo Server:

```TypeScript
// Initialize Apollo Server
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: () => ({ authorLoader })
});

// Start the server
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:

* The `context` function adds the Data Loader to the context so it is available to the resolvers.

## Testing Your Implementation
Finally, let's test our implementation by running some queries in a separate run.ts file:

```TypeScript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const query = `
  query {
    books {
      title
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

const url = 'http://localhost:4000/';

fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query,
  }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

const authorQuery = `
  query {
    author(id: "1") {
      name
    }
  }
`;

fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: authorQuery,
  }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

Output expected:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "The Hobbit",
        "author": {
          "name": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Harry Potter",
        "author": {
          "name": "J.K. Rowling"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "author": {
      "name": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    }
  }
}
```
Everything should work correctly, fetching the required data while only making the necessary requests.
