# Using DataLoader for GraphQL Optimization

Welcome to the final task of this course! You have successfully learned how to define GraphQL schemas, implement nested resolvers, and use `DataLoader` to optimize your queries and avoid the N+1 problem. In this task, you will put all your knowledge together and write a complete GraphQL server from scratch.

Your task is to create a GraphQL server with `Restaurant`, `Dish`, and `Ingredient` types and define queries for fetching dishes and restaurants. Additionally, you will need to set up a `DataLoader` to batch and cache ingredient queries to optimize performance. Once your server is ready, you will also write a client script to query the server and fetch the desired data.
