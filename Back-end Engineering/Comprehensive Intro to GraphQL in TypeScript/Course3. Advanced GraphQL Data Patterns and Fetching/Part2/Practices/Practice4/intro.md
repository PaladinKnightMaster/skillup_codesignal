# Implement Pagination with Nested Types

Awesome job getting here! In this exercise, you'll work on a GraphQL server to implement nested types for `Author` and `Book` and also add pagination to the query.

The provided `server.ts` script defines the basic GraphQL schema and sets up sample data, but the schema for nested types and pagination logic is incomplete. Your goal is to complete the definitions for the nested schema, the resolvers, and add pagination logic for the `books` and `authors` queries, as well as for nested `books` within `Author`.

This task will deepen your understanding of fetching nested data with pagination in GraphQL.
