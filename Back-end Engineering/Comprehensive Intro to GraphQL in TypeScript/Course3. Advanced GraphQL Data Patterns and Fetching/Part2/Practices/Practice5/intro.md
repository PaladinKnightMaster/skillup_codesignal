# Nested Types and Pagination in GraphQL

Congratulations on making it this far! Now, it's time to put your skills to the test by writing a GraphQL server with nested types and pagination.

In this task, you will define and implement the schema, resolvers, and pagination logic for nested types: `Film`, `Actor`, and `StreamingService`.

1. Define the nested `Film`, `Actor`, and `StreamingService` types in your schema.
2. Implement the resolvers to handle queries for these nested types.
3. Add pagination to the `films` query.
4. Complete the query in `run.ts` to fetch films with pagination.

This task will solidify your understanding of nested types and pagination in GraphQL.
