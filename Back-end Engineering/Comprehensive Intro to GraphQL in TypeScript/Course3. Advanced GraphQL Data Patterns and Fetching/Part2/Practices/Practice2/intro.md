# Debug GraphQL Pagination Logic

Welcome back! For this exercise, your task is to debug and fix a GraphQL server with pagination logic. The given script sets up an `Apollo Server` with a `GraphQL schema` and a simple `resolver` to handle pagination. However, there is a logical issue preventing proper pagination.

Your goal is to identify and correct the bug in the `resolver` so that it correctly returns the paginated list of books.
