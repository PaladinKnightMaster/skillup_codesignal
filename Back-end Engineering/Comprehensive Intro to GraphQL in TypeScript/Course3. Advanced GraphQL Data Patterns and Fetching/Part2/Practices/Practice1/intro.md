# Adding Default Pagination Values

You've done well so far! For this exercise, you will take the given `books` query resolver with pagination and modify it to include default values for `limit` and `offset` when they're not provided. The goal is to ensure the `books` resolver uses `limit = 10` and `offset = 0` as defaults if the arguments are not explicitly given in the query.

This task will enhance your understanding of fetching paginated data using default argument values.
