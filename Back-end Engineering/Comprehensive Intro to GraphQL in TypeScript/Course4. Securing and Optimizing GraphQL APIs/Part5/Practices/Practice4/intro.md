# Implementing GraphQL Server and Testing

Excellent progress so far! In this task, you need to build a GraphQL server from scratch that includes a `Car` type, a query to retrieve cars, a query to retrieve the car by its ID, a mutation to add a new car, and a mutation to delete the existing car by its ID. This server will manage a list of cars and allow you to add new cars dynamically.
