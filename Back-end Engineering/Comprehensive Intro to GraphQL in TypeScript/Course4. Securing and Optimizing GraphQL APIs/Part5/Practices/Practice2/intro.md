# Debug Apollo Server with Books

Excellent progress so far!

In this task, you will debug and fix a basic GraphQL server script aimed at adding and retrieving books along with their publication years. The script is intended to support operations such as fetching the list of books and adding a new book, but it contains some errors that need rectification. Your task is to identify and fix the issues, ensuring that the server handles the addition and retrieval of books with their `publishedYear` field correctly.
