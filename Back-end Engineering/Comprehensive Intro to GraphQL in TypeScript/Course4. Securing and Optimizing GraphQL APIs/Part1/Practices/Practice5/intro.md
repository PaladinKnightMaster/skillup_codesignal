# Secure GraphQL Server with Authentication

Fantastic progress! For this task, you are required to implement a GraphQL server that includes a login mutation to authenticate users and an addBook mutation to add a new book to the collection. Be sure to enforce authentication logic by checking the token provided in the request headers.

On top of that, make sure to implement the missing parts in the server querying code.
