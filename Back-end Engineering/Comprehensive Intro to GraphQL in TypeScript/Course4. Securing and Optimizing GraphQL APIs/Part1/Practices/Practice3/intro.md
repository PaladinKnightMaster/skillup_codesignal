# Secure Your GraphQL Mutations

Fantastic progress! For this task, you are required to implement a GraphQL server that includes a `login` mutation to authenticate users. The `addPost` mutation has already been implemented. Be sure to enforce authentication logic by checking the token provided in the request headers.

Once the `login` mutation is implemented, don't forget to implement the code to call it along with posts querying and post addition mutations.
