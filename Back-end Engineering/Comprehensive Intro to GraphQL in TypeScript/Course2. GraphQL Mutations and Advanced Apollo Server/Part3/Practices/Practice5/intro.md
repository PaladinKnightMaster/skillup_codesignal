# Real-Time Updates with Subscriptions

Excellent progress! Now, it's time for the final task. Implement a GraphQL server using Apollo Server with real-time subscription features for book additions.

You will write the `schema`, `resolvers`, and set up the server from scratch. And don't forget to process the subscription properly in `run.ts` as well.
