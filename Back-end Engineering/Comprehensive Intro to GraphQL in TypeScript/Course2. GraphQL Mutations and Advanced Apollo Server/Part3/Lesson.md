# Setting Up Subscriptions for Real-Time Data

## Lesson Overview
Welcome to this lesson on "**Setting Up Subscriptions for Real-Time Data**". In this lesson, we will discuss real-time data and subscriptions to events in GraphQL.

GraphQL Subscriptions enable clients to listen for real-time updates from the server. When an event that matches the subscriptionâ€™s criteria occurs, the server sends the updated data to the client automatically.

This is how subscriptions differ from Queries and Mutations:

* **Queries**: Request data from the server.
* **Mutations**: Modify data on the server.
* **Subscriptions**: Receive updates whenever data is changed as specified.

## Setting Up Apollo Server with Subscriptions
Let's begin by setting up our `Apollo Server` to handle subscriptions. We'll start by initializing our server and defining our schema, including the `Subscription` type.

We'll also be using `PubSub` from `graphql-subscriptions`, which is an in-memory event system for publishing and subscribing to events. This allows our resolvers to notify clients about real-time updates.

```TypeScript
import { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server-express';
import express from 'express';
import { PubSub } from 'graphql-subscriptions';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { SubscriptionServer } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';
import { execute, subscribe } from 'graphql';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';

// Initialize PubSub
const pubsub = new PubSub();
```

## Defining Schema and Resolvers with Subscriptions
In this section, we'll define the schema with a type definition that includes a **Subscription** type.

```TypeScript
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Book {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: String!
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
  }

  type Mutation {
    addBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book
  }

  type Subscription {
    bookAdded: Book
  }
`;
```
The `Subscription` type defines a `bookAdded` field which is of type `Book`.

## Writing Resolver Functions
Next, we need to implement resolver functions for these subscriptions. When a new book is added via the `addBook` mutation, it publishes an event called `BOOK_ADDED` which `PubSub` handles, triggering the subscription. This allows subscribed clients to receive real-time updates about the new book.

```TypeScript
// Sample data
let books = [
  { id: '1', title: 'The Hobbit', author: 'J.R.R. Tolkien' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Harry Potter', author: 'J.K. Rowling' },
];

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
  },
  Mutation: {
    addBook: (_: any, { title, author }: { title: string, author: string }) => {
      const newBook = { id: uuidv4(), title, author };
      books.push(newBook);
      pubsub.publish('BOOK_ADDED', { bookAdded: newBook });
      return newBook;
    },
  },
  Subscription: {
    bookAdded: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['BOOK_ADDED']),
    },
  },
};
```
Here, when a book is added using the `addBook` mutation, the new book data is sent to all clients subscribing to the `bookAdded` subscription through the `pubsub.publish` method.

## Integrating WebSocket for Real-Time Updates
WebSockets provide a way for a server and a client to communicate in real-time over a single, long-lived connection. This is crucial for handling subscriptions.

We'll integrate WebSockets into our `Apollo Server` setup to handle subscriptions.

```TypeScript
// Define the schema
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// Initialize the Express application
const app = express();

// Create the HTTP server
const httpServer = createServer(app);

// Initialize Apollo Server
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization || '';
    return { token };
  }
});

// Start the Apollo server and Subscription server
const startServer = async () => {
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  SubscriptionServer.create(
    { schema, execute, subscribe },
    { server: httpServer, path: '/graphql' }
  );

  httpServer.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:4000/graphql`);
  });
};

startServer();
```
When you run this code, your server should be ready to handle real-time subscriptions.

## Requesting Subscriptions after Setting Up the Server
After setting up the server to handle subscriptions, it's essential to know how to request and subscribe to real-time data updates. Below, we will provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a client to request subscriptions.

First, set up the required endpoints and data structures.

```TypeScript
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import { ExecutionResult } from 'graphql';

// Type definitions for GraphQL responses
interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author: string;
}

interface BooksQueryResponse {
  books: Book[];
}

interface AddBookMutationResponse {
  addBook: Book;
}

interface BookAddedSubscriptionPayload {
  bookAdded: Book;
}
```

## GraphQL Queries and Mutations
Define the queries and mutations that will be used in the client application.

```TypeScript
const getBooksQuery = gql`
  query {
    books {
      id
      title
      author
    }
  }
`;

const addBookMutation = gql`
  mutation($title: String!, $author: String!) {
    addBook(title: $title, author: $author) {
      id
      title
      author
    }
  }
`;

const bookAddedSubscription = gql`
  subscription {
    bookAdded {
      id
      title
      author
    }
  }
`;
```

## Helper Function for Sending GraphQL Requests
Create a function to facilitate sending GraphQL requests.

```TypeScript
// Define the GraphQL endpoint
const GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:4000/graphql';
const WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT = 'ws://localhost:4000/graphql';

const fetchGraphQL = async <T>(query: string, variables?: Record<string, any>): Promise<T> => {
  const response = await fetch(GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
  });
  const result = (await response.json()) as ExecutionResult<T>;
  if (!result.errors) {
    return result.data as T;
  } else {
    throw new Error(`GraphQL error: ${result.errors.map((e: any) => e.message).join(', ')}`);
  }
};
```

## Setting Up WebSocket for Subscriptions
Initialize the WebSocket client and set up the subscription for real-time updates.

```TypeScript
const client = new SubscriptionClient(WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT, { reconnect: true }, WebSocket);

const subscription = client.request({ query: bookAddedSubscription.loc?.source.body! }).subscribe({
  next(response) {
    const data = response.data as { bookAdded: Book };
    if (data && data.bookAdded) {
      console.log('Book added:', data.bookAdded);
    } else {
      console.error('Subscription response was null or undefined:', response);
    }

    delay(1000).then(() => {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
      client.close();
      checkCompletion();
    });
  },
  error(error) {
    console.error('Subscription error:', error);
    client.close();
    checkCompletion();
  },
});
```

## Executing Queries and Mutations
Execute the defined queries and mutations.

```TypeScript
let tasksCompleted = 0;
const totalTasks = 3;

function checkCompletion() {
  tasksCompleted += 1;
  if (tasksCompleted === totalTasks) {
    console.log('All tasks completed.');
    process.exit(0);
  }
}

// Fetch books
fetchGraphQL<{ books: Book[] }>(getBooksQuery.loc?.source.body!)
  .then((data) => console.log('Books:', data.books))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching books:', error))
  .finally(() => checkCompletion());

// Add a new book
fetchGraphQL<{ addBook: Book }>(addBookMutation.loc?.source.body!, { title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' })
  .then((data) => console.log('Added book:', data.addBook))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error adding book:', error))
  .finally(() => checkCompletion());
```
