# Integrate Apollo with Express

Great work so far! Now, let's integrate `Apollo Server` with `Express` for a **GraphQL API** that manages a list of actors.

The provided code sets up the schema, sample data, and resolvers, but the `Express` integration is missing. Complete the code by filling in the missing parts to get the server running correctly.

Follow TODO comments in `server.ts` and `run.ts` to fill in the gaps.
