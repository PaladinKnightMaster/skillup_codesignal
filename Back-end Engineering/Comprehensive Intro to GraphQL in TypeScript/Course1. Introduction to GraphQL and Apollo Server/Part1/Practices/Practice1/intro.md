# Modify GraphQL Resolver Message

Great work so far! Let's move on to modifying the existing GraphQL server.

Currently, our server responds with `"Hello, GraphQL!"` when we send a query. We want to change this message to `"Hello, Superheroes!"` instead.

Modify the code to update the resolver so that it returns `"Hello, Superheroes!"` instead of `"Hello, GraphQL!"`.
