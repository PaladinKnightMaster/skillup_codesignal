# Query Books by Title

Well done on setting up and querying with arguments in GraphQL. Now, let's enhance our GraphQL server.

You will add a new query type in the schema to fetch a book by its `title` along with its `author`. Update the schema and resolver to handle the new query type. Follow TODO comments in the code to fill in the gaps in the server and client files!
