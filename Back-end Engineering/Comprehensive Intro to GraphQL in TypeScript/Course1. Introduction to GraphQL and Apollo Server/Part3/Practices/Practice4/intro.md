# Add a Movie Query

So far, you've learned how to query with arguments in GraphQL.

In this practice, you'll extend the schema definition and resolve the queries. Add a new type `Movie` with fields `id`, `title`, and `director`. Then, add the query type to fetch a single movie by `id` as well as a list of movies. Include the sample data for movies and update the resolver.
