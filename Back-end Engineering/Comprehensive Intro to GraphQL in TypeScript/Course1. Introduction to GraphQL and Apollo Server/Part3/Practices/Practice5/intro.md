# Build a GraphQL Movie Server

Great work reaching this point! Previously, you learned how to set up and query with arguments in **GraphQL**.

Now, put your skills into action by setting up a **GraphQL** server that allows querying movies by their `ID`. You will define the schema, provide sample data, write resolvers, and initialize the `ApolloServer`. Finally, you will implement a script to query all movies and a specific movie by its `ID`.

Follow TODO comments in the code to fill in the gaps in the server and client files!
