# Adding Up Travel Days

Great job on the previous exercises! Now let's practice calculating the remaining days after visiting multiple locations.

You are given code that declares variable names and their values for total days available and days spent in different places. Your task is to complete the missing parts of the code to get the remaining number of days and display the result.

Before you start, let's understand the subtracting operation in Ruby. Subtracting two numbers in Ruby is done using the `-` operator. Here's an example:

```Ruby
# Subtracting two numbers
result = 10 - 5
puts result # Output: 5
```

Similarly, you can subtract variables that store numbers. Here's an example:

```Ruby
# Subtracting variables
variable1 = 10
variable2 = 5
result = variable1 - variable2
puts result # Output: 5
```

With this information in mind, complete the code to calculate the remaining travel days after visiting different locations. Follow the `TODO` instructions in the code to complete the task.
