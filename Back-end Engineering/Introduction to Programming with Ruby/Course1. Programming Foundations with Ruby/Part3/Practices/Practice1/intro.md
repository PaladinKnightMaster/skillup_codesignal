# Managing Travel Days in Ruby

Great job understanding how to declare and use variables! Now let's run the code from the lesson to see how it works in practice.

In this example, we will:

1. Declare the number of days spent in each location.
2. Calculate the total number of days.
3. Display the total number of days.
Running this will help you see the result of managing quantities using variables.
