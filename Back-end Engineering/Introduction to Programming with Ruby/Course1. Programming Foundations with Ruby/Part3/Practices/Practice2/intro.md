# Managing Days in Iconic Cities

Great work so far! Let's build on our previous task.

Change the script to calculate the time spent in different iconic cities: `"days_in_London"`, `"days_in_Paris"`, and `"days_in_NewYork"`.

Use the following values: `days_in_London = 6`, `days_in_Paris = 8`, and `days_in_NewYork = 10`. Then, calculate the total number of days and display the result.
