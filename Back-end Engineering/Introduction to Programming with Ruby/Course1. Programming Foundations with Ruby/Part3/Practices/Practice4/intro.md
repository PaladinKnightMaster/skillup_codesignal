# Calculating the Number of Photos

Great job on the previous tasks! Now let's modify our existing script to include the use of the multiplication operator.

Change the code to calculate the total number of photos you can take based on the number of days you spend in each country and the average number of photos you take per day. Update the calculation to multiply the number of days in each country by the number of photos you take per day, and then add the results together.

Before you start, let's explore the multiplication operator:

The multiplication operator `*` is used to multiply two numbers together, for example, `2 * 3` equals `6`. Let's see how we can perform multiplication in Ruby:

```Ruby
# Multiplying two numbers
result = 2 * 3
puts result # This will output 6
```

Note: In Ruby, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so it is performed before addition: `2 + 3 * 4` equals `14`. Make sure to use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations!
