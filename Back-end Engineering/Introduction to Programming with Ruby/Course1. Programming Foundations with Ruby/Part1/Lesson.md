# Starting Your Ruby Journey: Hello World Script

## Welcome to Your First Ruby Script
Welcome to the exciting world of Ruby programming! In this lesson, you'll be writing your very first Ruby script. This is where every programmer begins — by having a computer say, "Hello, world!". It's a straightforward but fundamental step that signifies the beginning of your learning journey in **Ruby**.

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, we will cover:

1. **Basic Syntax**: You'll learn the basic syntax required for writing and running a Ruby script.
2. **Output to Console**: We'll explore how to utilize the `puts` method to display messages on the screen.
3. **Comments**: Lastly, we will introduce single-line and multi-line comments, which are essential for documenting your code.

Below is an example to provide you with an initial preview:

```Ruby
puts 'Hello, world!'

# Single-line comment

=begin
Multiline
Comment
=end
```
This simple script displays "Hello, world!" on the console and includes both single-line and multi-line comments.

Notice that we use the `#` symbol for single-line comments and the `=begin` and `=end` keywords for multi-line comments. Comments are essential for documenting your code and making it more readable.

## Why It Matters
Composing your first Ruby script is an important milestone. It acquaints you with the fundamental structure of Ruby code and lays a foundation for everything else you'll learn. Understanding how to output text to the console is crucial, as it allows you to visually observe and debug your work.

Comments hold equal importance as they assist both you and others in comprehending the purpose of your code, making it more readable and manageable. Becoming accustomed to properly commenting your code is a professional habit that you'll employ throughout your programming career.

Are you excited to begin? Let’s dive into the practice section and construct your first Ruby script together. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a functioning "Hello, world!" program and a solid understanding of the basic Ruby syntax.
