# Running Your First Ruby Script

Let's run the code you saw in the lesson, and pay close attention to the output. This will help reinforce the basic structure of a Ruby script.

In Ruby, the `puts` method prints text to the console. Comments in Ruby are used to document your code and are ignored by the interpreter.

There are two types of comments:

1. **Single-line comment**: Begins with a `#` and continues to the end of the line.
2. **Multiline comment**: Begins with `=begin` and ends with `=end`. Everything between these markers is considered a comment.

Here is an example to remind you of how it looks:

```Ruby
puts 'Hello, world!'

# Single-line comment

=begin
Multiline
Comment
=end
```
In this practice, you will execute a slightly different version of the code you saw in the lesson. Running this code will help you see how the output works and how comments are written in Ruby.
