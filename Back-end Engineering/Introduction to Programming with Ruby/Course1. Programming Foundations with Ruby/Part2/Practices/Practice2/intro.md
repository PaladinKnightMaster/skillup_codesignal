# Change Variable Values in Ruby

Great progress! Now let's make a small change to our existing code.

Currently, the code sets the starting point to `"New York"` and the destination to `"Paris."`

Change the starting point to `"Los Angeles"` and the destination to `"Tokyo."`

Run the code after making the changes to see the updated output.
