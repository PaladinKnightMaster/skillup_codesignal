# Adding and Reading Events in Redis Streams

Great job so far! In the last few tasks, you practiced adding and reading events from a Redis stream.

For this challenge, you'll need to apply everything you've learned.

Your tasks are to:

1. Add three different types of events to a stream named `eventstream`.
2. Read and print the first two messages from the stream.
