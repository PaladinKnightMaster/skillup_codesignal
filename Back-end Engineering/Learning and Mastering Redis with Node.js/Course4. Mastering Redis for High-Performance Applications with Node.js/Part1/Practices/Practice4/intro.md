# Adding and Processing Math Operations in Redis Streams

You've been doing great! In the previous tasks, you learned how to add and read events from a Redis stream.

Now, let's practice adding different types of events to a Redis stream and processing them based on their event type. You will be working with a stream named math_operations. Fill in the missing parts of the provided code to add `add` and `sub` events, process them, and print the result.
