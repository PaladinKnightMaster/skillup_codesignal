# Retrieve Username from Redis Hash

Nice work so far! Now, letâ€™s modify our existing Redis hash example to store and retrieve specific field values.

Your task is to change the given code to retrieve only the `username` field of `user:1000` instead of all fields.

We'll use the `hGet` method for this. The `hGet` method retrieves the value associated with a specific field of a hash. Here's the syntax:

```JavaScript
await client.hGet(hash_name, field)
```

Make the necessary changes to the code to achieve this.
