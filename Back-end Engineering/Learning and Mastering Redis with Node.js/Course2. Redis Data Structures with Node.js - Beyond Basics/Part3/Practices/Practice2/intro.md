# Tracking Artists' Active Status Using Bitmaps in Redis

Nice work so far! Now let's put that knowledge into practice.

In this task, you'll need to track the active status of artists using bits in `Redis`. Some parts of the code are missing. Your goal is to complete the code where you see `TODO`.

Specifically, you will:

1. Set bits to track whether specific artists are online.
2. Get and print the status of two of the artists.
