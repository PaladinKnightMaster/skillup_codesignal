# Tracking User Online Status with Redis Bitmaps

In this task, you will create your own bitmap in Redis using JavaScript to track the online status of users in a chat application. Each bit in the bitmap will represent a user, with 1 indicating that a user is online and 0 indicating that the user is offline.

You will need to:

1. Set bits for multiple users to mark them as online or offline.
2. Retrieve and print the online status of a few users.
