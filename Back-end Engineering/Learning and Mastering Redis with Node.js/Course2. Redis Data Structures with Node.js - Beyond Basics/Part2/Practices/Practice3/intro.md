# Retrieve Lowest Scoring Players

Great work so far!

Now, let's deepen your understanding of ranks. We want to find the rank of a player in the leaderboard, ranked from high to low scores.

Currently, the code uses `zRank` to get the rank of a player. However, `zRank` returns the rank of a player from low to high scores. We need to change the code to get the rank of a player from high to low scores.

Change the given code to retrieve and display the rank of a specific player, ranked from highest to lowest score.
