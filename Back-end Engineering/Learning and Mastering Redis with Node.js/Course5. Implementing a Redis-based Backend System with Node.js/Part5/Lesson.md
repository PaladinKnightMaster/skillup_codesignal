# Implementing Pub/Sub for Notifications

## Implementing Pub/Sub for Notifications
Welcome! In this unit, we will delve into implementing Pub/Sub for notifications within our **Redis-based backend system project**. You've already learned how to manage user data, handle transactions, and use streams for event logging. Now, we'll add another powerful feature to our project: real-time notifications using Redis Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe). This will enable our system to send and receive messages instantaneously.

## What You'll Build
In this unit, we'll focus on creating a simple real-time notification system using Redis Pub/Sub. Specifically, we'll cover:

1. **Publishing Messages**: How to send notifications.
2. **Subscribing to Channels**: How to receive and handle notifications.

Let's quickly refresh how Pub/Sub works in Redis using JavaScript:

```JavaScript
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });

await client.connect();

const pubsub = client.duplicate();
await pubsub.connect();

function messageHandler(message) {
    const data = JSON.parse(message);
    console.log(`Received message from ${data.user}: ${data.text}`);
}

async function subscribeToChannel(channel) {
    await pubsub.subscribe(channel, (message) => {
        messageHandler(message);
    });
}

async function publishMessage(channel, message) {
    await client.publish(channel, JSON.stringify(message));
}

// Example usage
const channelName = 'chat_room';
await subscribeToChannel(channelName);

const message = { user: 'alice', text: 'Hello everyone!' };
await publishMessage(channelName, message); // Output: Received message from alice: Hello everyone!

await pubsub.unsubscribe(channelName);
await pubsub.disconnect();
await client.disconnect();
```

In this JavaScript code snippet:

1. The `publishMessage` function publishes a message to a given channel.
2. The `messageHandler` function handles incoming messages from the subscribed channel.
3. The `subscribeToChannel` function subscribes to a specified channel and listens for incoming messages.

Exciting, isnâ€™t it? Now, it's time to put this into practice. Let's implement the complete code to build our real-time notification system.

Happy coding!
