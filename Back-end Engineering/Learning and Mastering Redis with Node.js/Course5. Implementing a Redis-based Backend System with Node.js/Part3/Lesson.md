# Handling Transactions with Pipelines

## Handling Transactions with Pipelines
Welcome back! We're moving on to the next essential part of our **Redis-based backend system** project — handling transactions with pipelines. This will help us execute multiple Redis commands as a single atomic operation. Remember, you've already gotten comfortable with managing user data and leaderboards. This unit will take it a step further by optimizing these operations using pipelines.

## What You'll Build
Before we dive in, let's recap what you’ll be focusing on in this unit. The key tasks include:

1. **Adding user data with expiration using pipelines**: We will group multiple commands into one pipeline to add user data more efficiently.
2. **Adding scores to a leaderboard using pipelines**: Using pipelines to add scores will ensure these operations are atomically executed.
3. **Executing the pipeline**: We'll ensure the grouped commands in the pipeline are executed together.

These tasks will help us understand how pipelines can enhance performance and consistency in our Redis operations.

Here's a snippet to remind you of how pipelines work:

```JavaScript
import { createClient } from 'redis';
const client = createClient();

client.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error connecting to Redis', err);
});

await client.connect();

const users = [
    { username: 'alice', data: { name: 'Alice', age: 30, email: 'alice@example.com' } },
    { username: 'bob', data: { name: 'Bob', age: 25, email: 'bob@example.com' } }
];

const pipeline = client.multi();
users.forEach(user => {
    pipeline.set(`user:${user.username}`, JSON.stringify(user.data), { 'EX': 86400 });
});
const result = await pipeline.exec();
console.log(result); // Output: [ 'OK', 'OK' ]

const user = await client.get('user:alice');
console.log(user) // Output: {"name":"Alice","age":30,"email":"alice@example.com"}

await client.disconnect();
```

This way, all commands in the pipeline are sent to the Redis server in one batch when pipeline.exec() is called. This ensures that the commands are executed atomically.

Let's go! The more you practice, the better you'll get at building efficient backend systems.
