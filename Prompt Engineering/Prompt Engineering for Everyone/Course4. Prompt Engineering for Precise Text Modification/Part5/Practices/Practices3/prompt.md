Given Text:

The stale air of the derelict cabin was thick with tension as the Hero, cornered yet defiant, faced the Antagonist, who exuded a calm malice.

- Hero: "You've led me into a trap, but I won't fall for your games."
- Antagonist: "Oh, but you see, it's more than a game. It's about revealing true colors."

They stood, a mere breath apart, the gravity of their shared past weighing heavily between them.

- Hero: "What's at stake is more than our past; it's the future I'm trying to save."
- Antagonist: "And in your noble quest, how many innocents have you put at risk?"

__ASK__
Add distinct markers to identify the dialogue of two specific characters: the Hero and the Antagonist. Use a caret symbol (`^`) next to the Hero's dialogue and an asterisk (`*`) next to the Antagonist's dialogue, placing the marker immediately after the colon following "Hero" and "Antagonist." Do not alter any other part of the original text.

__CONSTRAINTS__
- Only add the specified markers immediately after the colon following "Hero" and "Antagonist."
- Ensure the labels are consistently applied to all lines of dialogue without modifying the existing text.
