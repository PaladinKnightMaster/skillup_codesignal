# Crafting the Betrayal Dialogue

This time let's modify the given prompt to help it insert distinct markers that identify the dialogue of two specific characters: the Hero and the Antagonist. Add a caret symbol (`^`) next to the Hero's dialogue and an asterisk (`*`) next to the Antagonist's dialogue. Ensure to only add these labels without altering the original text.

Here is sample output:

- ^Hero: "You've led me into a trap, but I won't fall for your games."
- *Antagonist: "Oh, but you see, it's more than a game. It's about revealing true colors."
