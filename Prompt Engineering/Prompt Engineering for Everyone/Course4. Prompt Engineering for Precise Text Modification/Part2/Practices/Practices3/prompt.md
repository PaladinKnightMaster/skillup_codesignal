However, Steve Jobs's management style was also a source of controversy. Described as demanding and intensely critical, he could be challenging to work with, often pushing employees to their limits to achieve the perfection he envisioned. His approach led to numerous conflicts and was characterized by some as tyrannical.

Jobs's early reluctance to engage in philanthropic activities also drew criticism, contrasting with the practices of other high-profile billionaires. Though in his later years, he and his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, made significant, albeit less publicized, charitable contributions.
