<!-- Albert Einstein, a theoretical physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and the equation E=mc^2, which states that energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. This groundbreaking work has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and our understanding of the universe.

In 1905, Einstein published four papers in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal, which collectively are known as the Annus Mirabilis papers. Among these, was the paper on the Special Theory of Relativity, which introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time. He argued that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels.

Einstein's theory dramatically changed the way we understand the behavior of objects in motion and the flow of time across the universe. It introduced the concept that time and space are intertwined into a single continuum known as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another.

In 1915, Einstein expanded on his Special Theory of Relativity by introducing the General Theory of Relativity. This theory proposed that gravity is not a force as it appears in Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, but rather is a consequence of the curvature of space-time caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The more massive an object, the more it warps the space around it.

The General Theory of Relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and has provided a comprehensive framework for understanding cosmological phenomena, including black holes and the expansion of the universe. Einstein's theories of relativity remain central to modern physics and astronomy, influencing the development of technologies such as GPS navigation and advancing our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level. -->
