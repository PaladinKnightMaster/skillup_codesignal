# From Bullets to Checkboxes

Using the Iterative Prompt Construction technique build a new prompt from scratch that will create a markdown checkbox list from the given list. Make sure to include an example input/output by building simpler prompts first and using the outputs to enhance your main prompt.

Feel free to use LLM interactions to build your test example as well.
