__ASK__
How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?

__REQUIREMENTS__
- Think step-by-step.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing how many digits are needed for different ranges of numbers (e.g., 1-9, 10-99, 100-500).
- Calculate the total number of digits for each range separately.
- Add up the results to get the final number of keystrokes.
- Show all intermediate calculations clearly before concluding with the final answer.
