__REQUIREMENTS__
- Forward Analysis:
  - Think step-by-step to analyze the problem without proposing a final answer initially.
- Backtracking:
  - After completing the initial step-by-step analysis, revisit and revise earlier steps to resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies.
  - Use backtracking to validate and adjust the proposed digits iteratively until all constraints are satisfied.
