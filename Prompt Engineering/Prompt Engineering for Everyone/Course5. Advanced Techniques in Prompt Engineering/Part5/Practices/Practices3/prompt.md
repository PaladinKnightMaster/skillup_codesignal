Find a 10-digit number where the first digit is how many zeros in the number, the second digit is how many 1s in the number etc. until the tenth digit which is how many 9s in the number.

__REQUIREMENTS__
- Forward Analysis
  - Think step-by-step to analyze the problem - do not suggest an answer.
- Backtracking
   - After the initial step-by-step analysis, work backward from the end to come up with the answer. -->

__ASK__

Find a 10-digit number where the first digit is how many zeros in the number, the second digit is how many 1s in the number, and so on until the tenth digit, which is how many 9s in the number.

__REQUIREMENTS__
- Brainstorming:
  - Before analyzing the problem, brainstorm potential approaches to solve it.
  - List the logical steps or strategies to ensure all constraints are met without attempting a solution.
- Forward Analysis:
  - Think step-by-step to analyze the problem based on the brainstormed strategies. Do not suggest a final answer during this phase.
- Backtracking:
  - After completing the forward analysis, revisit earlier steps, working backward to refine and validate the digits.
  - Resolve any conflicts iteratively to ensure the solution satisfies all constraints.
