Summarize the impact of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hike on the stock market today.

__CONTEXT__
The stock market's reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hike presented a complex picture, with investor sentiments divided across different sectors. On one hand, the technology and healthcare sectors exhibited remarkable resilience, buoyed perhaps by the anticipation of continued demand and innovation despite the broader economic tightening. Companies within these sectors seemed to leverage their robust growth prospects and strong balance sheets to weather the uncertainty brought about by the interest rate adjustments. Investors in these areas appeared to focus on long-term growth opportunities, undeterred by the immediate ripples of monetary policy changes.

Conversely, the general market trended downwards in the wake of the announcement, reflecting widespread concerns over higher borrowing costs and their potential to slow down economic growth. Sectors more sensitive to interest rate hikes, such as real estate and consumer discretionary, felt the brunt of the market's apprehension. For these industries, the increased cost of financing could dampen consumer spending and investment in development projects, thereby hindering growth. This divergence highlights the nuanced impact of monetary policy on different areas of the economy, with some sectors positioned to navigate the challenges more adeptly than others.

The mixed response also underscores the broader uncertainty pervading the market as investors grapple with the implications of the Federal Reserve's strategy to combat inflation. While the central bank aims to temper price increases by making borrowing more expensive, the risk of inadvertently triggering a slowdown looms large. As such, market participants are keenly watching for signs of how these monetary adjustments will affect consumer behavior, corporate earnings, and ultimately, the trajectory of economic growth. In this environment, the divergent sectoral performances serve as a reminder of the complex interplay between monetary policy, investor sentiment, and economic fundamentals. -->
