Generate a table for my report.

__CONTEXT__
- The report is about renewable energy sources across different countries.
- It should highlight the energy type, country, and the percentage of total energy produced by that source.
- It focuses on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.

__CONSTRAINTS__
- The table must have headers for "Energy Type", "Country", and "Percentage".
- Include at least 5 countries, with a mix of leading and developing nations.
- The table should be formatted in Markdown for easy integration into my digital report.
- Leave two empty rows between each energy type to visually separate them for clarity.
- See the example below but expand it to include the requested number of countries and the specified empty rows. -->
