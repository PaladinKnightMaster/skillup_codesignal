# Table Example

One great strategy for building up your prompts and including examples is to start without an example, then manually adjust the output you get to make it perfect and then include it as an example for future executions of the prompt.

In this task, you need to run this prompt, get the table (and only the table) from the output, and include it as an example in your prompt.
