<!-- I need a short and uplifting song about the spirit of teamwork for a children's animated football show. The show is called "Dream Team" and the main characters are a group of animated animals who form a football team. The team consists of Penny the Penguin (Goalkeeper), Leroy the Leopard (Striker), and Bobby the Bear (Captain and Midfielder). The song has to mention the characters by name and illustrate the importance of teamwork. The song should have a catchy chorus and two verses like the given example:

(Chorus)
Penny, Leroy and Bobby too,
Playing football, dream come true!
Through wind or rain, they got the knack,
With teamwork, there's no turning back.

(Verse 1)
A penguin in goal, wings spread wide,
Leroy leaps, no place to hide.
Bobby calls 'pass', then 'shoot',
When they play together, it's a hoot!

(Verse 2)
Through each challenge, they found a way,
United under the sun's bright ray.
Their dream was football, their spirit strong,
Together in team, where they belong. -->
