# Harmonizing Team Dreams

Construct a prompt that guides an LLM to craft a comprehensive plan for a software development team transitioning to remote work permanently. The aim is to ensure the prompt elicits detailed strategies covering communication, project management, team collaboration, and maintaining company culture in a remote environment. Include a well-structured example to showcase the format and depth of the desired output based on all you've learned so far.

Remember to use an initial run of the prompt to help you with the example instead of writing it from scratch.
