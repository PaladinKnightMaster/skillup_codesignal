# Effective Prompting from Scratch

Create a well-formatted prompt that asks the LLM to generate a markdown formatted table of LLM context limits. See if you can get it to include most of the well-known LLMs. Since the training cut-off date for this LLM is fairly recent, with right prompting, you should be able to get most of the well-known LLMs into the table.

Don't worry about the accuracy of the actual limits since a lot of the actual limits aren't even publicly known.
