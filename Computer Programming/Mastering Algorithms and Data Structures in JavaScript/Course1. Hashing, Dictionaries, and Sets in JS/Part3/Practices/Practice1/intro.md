# Unearthing the Lone Space Crew ID

Alright, Space Voyager, picture this: You've been assigned a crew and each member has a unique ID consisting of alphanumeric characters. Now, you're sifting through these IDs and need to find the first one that appears more than once in the array. If every ID unique or the array is empty, just return an empty string.

Now go on, rocket your solution to this! And don't forget, the answer format should be a string - that string is our elusive doubled ID or an empty string if we find no doubles in the array. Make it shine, Voyager!
