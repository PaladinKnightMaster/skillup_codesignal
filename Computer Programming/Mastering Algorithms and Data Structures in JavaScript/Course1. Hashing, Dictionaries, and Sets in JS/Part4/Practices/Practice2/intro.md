# Update Inventory to Remove Items

Alright, it's time to put your skills to the test once more. Today's challenge involves inventory management at our supermarket. It appears that we'll no longer be stocking *milk*. Your task is to update the starter code by employing the pertinent method to eliminate *milk* from our inventory map.

Ensure that your code handles this update gracefully, making our inventory list accurate and up-to-date. This exercise is a practical application of managing inventories and refining code for real-world scenarios.

Gear up and dive into the task! Remember to test your code thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected. Good luck!
