# Inventory Management Exercise

Good progress, Space Voyager! Now, can you manage the supermarket's inventory? Your task is to **add** an item with its quantity to the inventory, check the quantity of an existing item, print the total number of items in stock, **remove** an item from the inventory afterward and print the total number of items again.

Go ahead and implement anything missing!
