# Identifying Frequent Website Visitors

Imagine a situation where one of them visits the site more frequently, precisely, more than \( \frac{n}{4} \) times, where \( n \) is the total number of visits. If that's the case, you'd want to find out who it is.

Non-negative integers represent the identifiers, but ignore the case when the identifier is zero. If there's no such frequent user, your function should return \(-1\).
