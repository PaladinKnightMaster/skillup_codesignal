# Calculating Total Product Quantity in a Store Using HashMap

Listen up, Space Voyager! We've got an Object that holds each unique product sold in a store and its quantity. Every product key is a unique string, and its quantity is represented by an integer value. Now, your mission is to calculate the total quantity of all the products stocked in this store and return it as an integer.

I know you got this and can navigate through the cosmos of the code. Do remember, the Object you get as an input will not contain any unusual cases, it would be an ordinary universe with just products and their quantities. Put on your space helmet, fly high, and remember to have fun out there!
