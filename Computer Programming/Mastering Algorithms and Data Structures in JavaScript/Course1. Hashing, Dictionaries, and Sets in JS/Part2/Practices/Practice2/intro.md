# Removing Duplicate Email Addresses from an Array

Alright, Stellar Navigator, let's imagine we’ve got an integer array – picture it as a crowded pool of email addresses, where some addresses keep popping up more than once. Your mission? To write a function that dives in and rescues only the unique address IDs.

This function's gonna take that original array as an input. As for output, it ought to spit back an array, but this time with only the unique IDs. Think of it like cleaning up the pool, removing the duplicate addresses so every email address is a lone ranger.

The tricky part could be managing those edge cases. Arrays can be fickle beasts – empty or filled to the brim. It's your job to handle 'em both. So, ready to take the plunge, Navigator?
