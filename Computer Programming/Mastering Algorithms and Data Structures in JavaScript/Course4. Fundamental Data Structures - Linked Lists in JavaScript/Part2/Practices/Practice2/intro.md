# Exploring the Longest Increasing Sequence in a Space-Themed Linked List

Brace yourself, Space Voyager! This mission circles cosmos navigation. Given a pathway between planets - represented as a singly linked list- you must pinpoint a planet and uncover its position. You must traverse the linked list and calculate the number of nodes we visit before meeting the given value, including the target node itself. If the target number is not in the list, return `-1`.

Remember, the universe is limitless, and the planet could be any real value. Good luck, Detective! Uphold your adventurous spirit and happy coding!
