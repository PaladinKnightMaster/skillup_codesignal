# Linked List Reverse Traversal Challenge

Stellar Navigator, here's your mission: construct a function that navigates a given singly linked list from end to start, retrieving and printing the last n data points. We assure that `n` won't exceed the linked list's length. Ace this space chase using your coding toolkit, and be prepared for unexpected challenges on this celestial journey!
