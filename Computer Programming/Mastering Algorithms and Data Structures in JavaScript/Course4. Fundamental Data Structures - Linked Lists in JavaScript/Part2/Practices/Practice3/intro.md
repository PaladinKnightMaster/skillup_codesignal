# Reverse Search in a Linked List

Attention, Stellar Navigator! Your next mission is a fusion of two former tasks. In this puzzling cosmic chase, we've got a linked list representing pathways between planets. Your task is to pinpoint a specific planet, represented by a real number value, and unearth its position from the end of the list, where the last node has an index 0.

Assuming the Linked list is singly linked, create a function that traverses the list from end to start, counting the position of a target element. If the element is found, return its count from the end, else return `-1`. Remember, the universe doesn't have limits, and the target planet could be any real value. Good luck, and happy coding!
