# Space Convoy Cleanup: In-place Linked List Node Removal

Greetings Stellar Navigator! We have a stellar mission only you can handle. Our universe is carrying out a 'jumping jack' relay game where each player denotes a unique planet, each having their own time of travel. Your task is to find the sum of travel times to every second planet, but with a catch! We don't want to consider planets that are of equal distance away. It means if you have already added number n to the sum, don't add it again.

Your time starts now, Stellar Navigator!
