# Cosmic Library Clean-Up: Removing Obsolete Nodes Challenge

Hey Stellar Navigator, weâ€™ve got a job. Our digital gallery has some duplicate photos due to a mishap by my assistant. Your task? Remove the duplicates from our new photo list, represented by a singly linked list. Each node is a photo, denoted by the filename. Rest assured, the input list will always be non-empty.

Time to get coding and tidy up our gallery!
