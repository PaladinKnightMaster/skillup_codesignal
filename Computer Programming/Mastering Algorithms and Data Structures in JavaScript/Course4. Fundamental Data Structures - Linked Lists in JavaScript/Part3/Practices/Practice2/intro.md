# Average Mass Calculation of Selective Celestial Bodies in a Cosmic Linked List

Alright, Stellar Navigator, let's take it up a notch. We're handing you a baton relay race where each runner is a node in a linked list, each holding the runner's checkpoint timing. Your task is to find the total time of every alternating runner, pretty much like a leapfrog race!

Remember, your function accepts a linked list of integers: the checkpoint timings, with no limit to the number of nodes, and it returns an integer, the total time.

To infinity, and beyond!
