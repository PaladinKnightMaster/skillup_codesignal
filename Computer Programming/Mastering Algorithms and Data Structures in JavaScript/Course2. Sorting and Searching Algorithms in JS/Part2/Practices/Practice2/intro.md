# Adjust Book Search to Return Index Instead of Boolean

Alrighty, time to exercise your coding muscles again! In this practice task, I want you to adjust the starter code so that the boolean `recursiveBookSearch` function returns the index where the book is found, or `-1` if the book is not in the `library` array. Remember, you've just learned about the binary search, which is quite efficient in searching through sorted arrays.
