# Locating the Largest Coordinate in a Scrambled Array

Alright, Galactic Pioneer, here's a fun one for you. Picture this: You've got a bunch of stellar co-ordinates stored in an integer array that was once ascending. But during a hyper-jump, they got rotated and flipped, like [2,1,5,4,3] from [1,2,3,4,5]. The space anomaly didn't provide the location of the rotation pivot. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to whip up a function to find the biggest co-ordinate (max integer) in this muddled array.

Remember, your input is an array of integers and your output should be the largest integer in that array. Happy star surfing!
