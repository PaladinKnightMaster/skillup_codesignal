# Bitonic Sequence Number Locator

Alright, Space Voyager, here's your next assignment, a real noggin' buster! You have an array of unique numbers forming a 'bitonic sequence'. Now, that's a fancy term for a sequence that first increases, hits a peak, and then decreases. Just picture a cosmic roller coaster ride!

Your mission? Create a function, findPosition, that returns the 'index' of a given number, 'x', from that array. If 'x' is in hyperspace and not in our sequence, return -1.

Let's be precise: an input to findPosition is a number you want to locate, and the output is either the number's first occurrence position or -1 if the number does not exist. Now, go supe up your code engines, Voyager! You got this!
