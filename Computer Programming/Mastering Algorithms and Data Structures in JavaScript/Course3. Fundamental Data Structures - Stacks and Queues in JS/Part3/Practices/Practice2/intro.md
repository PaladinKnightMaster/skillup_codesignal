# Designing the MaxStack Class for Intergalactic Warehouse Management

Alright, Space Explorer, here's your next real-world task! Picture yourself managing a space warehouse, dealing with stacks of cosmic containers. But not just any stacks!

The task is to develop a "MaxStack" class that functions like a common Earthly Stack, offering the standard `push()` and `pop()` methods for adding and removing containers. However, you have a special gadget to always keep track of the heaviest container on the stack. So you need a `getMax()` function that effortlessly returns the maximum weight in the stack in `O(1)` time, much like our hyperdrive speed. You also need a `top()` function helpful to know the weight of the topmost container. Consider that weights are integer values, and both `push()` and `getMax()` will always be called with at least one element in the stack.
