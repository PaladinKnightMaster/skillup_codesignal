# Nearest Smaller Intergalactic Planets Identification

Hey, Galactic Pioneer, we've got a cosmic quest for you: imagine we're journeying through a galaxy filled with planets, each represented as an integer. Moving forward in our flight path (sequence), your mission is to identify the nearest planet (succeeding integer) that's bigger than our current location. Now, there might be some planets out there that happen to be of the same size or larger than any before them, so if you run across those, let's designate those as -1, star-hopper.

Once you're done with this interstellar expedition, return another sequence of integers where each is the closest bigger planet or -1 if no such planet exists. Now strap in and Godspeed, Space Voyager!
