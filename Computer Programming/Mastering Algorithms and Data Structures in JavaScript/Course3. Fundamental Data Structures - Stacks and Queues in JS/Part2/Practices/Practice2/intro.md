# Decoding Alien Messages: Reversing Alphabetical Characters In A String Using JavaScript

Alright, Space Voyager! Picture this: you're on a galactic mission and you've intercepted a coded string message from alien space pirates! But, there's a catch. You need to reverse the alphabetical characters in the string without affecting the non-alphabetical characters. So, if we have "ab-cd", the goal is to get "dc-ba" without touching that "-" in middle!

So here's our mission: I want you to build a JavaScript function that takes in our coded string as input, and returns a new string. This new string should have all alphabetical characters reversed, while all non-alphabetical characters remain in the very same positions they were originally. The incoming string could be any combination of letters and non-letter characters and could also be empty. The returned string should follow the same format.

No need to fret, Voyager. You got this! Let's decode that pirate message!
