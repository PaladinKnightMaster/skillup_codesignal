# Fix the Loop Errors

Nice progress so far! Now, let's identify and fix the bug in the code below. The code is supposed to keep track of the total amount spent on activities and print the remaining budget after each activity. However, the code is not working as expected. We don't see any message about spendings, although there is enough budget to spend on activities.

Can you identify the bug and fix it?
