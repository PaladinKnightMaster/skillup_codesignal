# Understanding `while` and `until` Loops in Ruby

## Understanding `while` and `until` Loops
In previous lessons, you've learned the basics of `for` and `each` loops as well as loop controls like `break` and `next` in Ruby. Now, itâ€™s time to dive deeper into other important loop structures: `while` and `until` loops. Understanding these loops will provide you with more tools to handle different programming challenges effectively.

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll explore how to use `while` and `until` loops to perform repetitive tasks based on conditions. With `while` loops, the code will run as long as a specified condition is true. Conversely, `until` loops will execute as long as a condition is false.

Let's examine some code examples to understand these concepts:

```Ruby
budget = 1200
spent = 0

amount = 250

# The condition checks if we can spend the amount without exceeding the budget limit
# The loop will run as long as the spent amount plus the new amount is less than or equal to the budget
while spent + amount <= budget
    # If the condition is true, we update the spent amount and print the total spent so far
    spent += amount
    puts "Spent #{spent} so far"
end

puts "Budget is now #{budget - spent}"
```

After exhausting the budget with a `while` loop, you might perform a similar task using an `until` loop:

```Ruby
budget = 1200
spent = 0

amount = 250

# The condition checks if we can spend the amount without exceeding the budget limit
# The loop will run until the spent amount plus the new amount exceeds the budget
until spent + amount > budget
    # If the condition is false, we update the spent amount and print the total spent so far
    spent += amount
    puts "Spent #{spent} so far"
end

puts "Budget is now #{budget - spent}"
```

## Why It Matters
Mastering `while` and `until` loops is essential for writing efficient and robust Ruby programs. These loops allow you to:

- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Handle operations that need to occur multiple times until a specific condition changes.
- **Write more readable and maintainable code**: Choosing the right loop structure can make your intentions clearer, leading to cleaner and more understandable code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of when and how to use `while` and `until` loops. This will enable you to tackle a variety of programming challenges more effectively.
