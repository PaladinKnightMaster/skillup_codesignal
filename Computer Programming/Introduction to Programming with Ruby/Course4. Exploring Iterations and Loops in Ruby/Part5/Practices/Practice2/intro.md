# Run the Travel Days Calculation
Great job so far!

Let's now examine a slightly modified version of the same code. As before, we have a hash where the keys are country names and the values are the number of days spent in each country. However, this time, instead of `each_value`, we are using `each_key` to iterate over the hash keys. In the loop, we take the value of the current key and add it to the total number of days spent in all countries.

Examine the code and run it to see how it works.
