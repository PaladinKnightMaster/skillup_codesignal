# Loop Controls - break, next

## Dive into Loop Controls
Welcome back! You've already learned the basics of loops in Ruby and how to iterate through collections using `for` and `each` loops. Now, let's take it one step further. In this lesson, we'll explore loop controls, specifically `break` and `next`. These powerful tools give you finer control over your loops, making your code even more efficient and flexible.

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll discover how to use `break` to exit a loop early and `next` to skip to the next iteration in a loop. These controls can make your loops more sophisticated and adaptable to different scenarios.

Here's a sneak peek at what we'll cover:

```Ruby
shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "honey", "bread", "butter", "chocolate"]
max_items = 4
items_processed = 0

# Loop through each item in the shopping list
shopping_list.each do |item|
    # Check if the maximum number of items has been processed
    if items_processed == max_items
        # If the maximum is reached, exit the loop early using 'break'
        puts "Max items processed. Exiting loop."
        break
    end
    # Increment the number of processed items
    items_processed += 1

    # Check if the item is honey, and skip expiration date check using 'next' if true
    if item == "honey"
        puts "Found honey. Honey never expires â€“ skipping Expiration Date check."
        next
    end
    puts "Checking Expiration Date: #{item}"
end
```

Let's break down the code for better understanding:

1. **Initialization**:

- We create an array called `shopping_list` containing several items.
- We set a variable `max_items` to 4, indicating the maximum number of items we want to process.
- We initialize `items_processed` to 0 to keep track of how many items have been processed.

2. **Loop Through Items**:

- The `each` method begins to iterate over each item in the `shopping_list`.

3. **Break Condition**:

- The loop checks if `items_processed` equals `max_items`.
- If true, it prints a message and uses break to exit the loop early.

4. **Increment Processed Items**:

- `items_processed` is incremented by 1 on each iteration, keeping track of the number of processed items.

5. **Next Condition**:

- If the current item is "honey", it prints a message and uses `next` to skip the expiration date check for this iteration, continuing to the next item.

6. **Expiration Date Check**:

- If the current item is not "honey", it prints a message checking the expiration date of the item.

## Why It Matters
Understanding how to control loops with `break` and `next` is vital for writing more effective and readable code. These commands empower you to:

- **Exit loops early**: Using `break`, you can stop a loop when a condition is met, saving time and resources.
- **Skip iterations**: With `next`, you can bypass specific cases within a loop, making your code cleaner and more efficient.

By mastering these loop controls, you'll be able to handle complex looping scenarios with ease, making your programs more robust and dynamic.
