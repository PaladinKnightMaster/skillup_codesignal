# Nested Loops in Action

Great job so far! We've learned how to use loops in Ruby. Now, let's see how nested loops help us handle more complex data structures.

In this exercise, we will run a code example that uses nested loops to plan sightseeing tours. We have a `hash` where each country maps to an `array` of places to visit. The outer loop iterates through the countries, while the inner loop goes through each place in a country.

Observe how the nested loops work together to print out the itinerary.
