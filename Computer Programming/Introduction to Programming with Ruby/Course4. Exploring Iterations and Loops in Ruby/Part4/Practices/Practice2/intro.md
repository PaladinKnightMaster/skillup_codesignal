# Adding Details to Nested Loops

Nice work on the previous tasks! Now, let's add more detail to our sightseeing planner.

You have a multi-country tour planned with a list of places to visit in each country. Each place has an estimated visit time.

Your task is to modify the code so that it prints the estimated visit time for each place on the list on the same line.

Before you start, notice how we used the underscore (`_`) in the block parameter for the inner loop. This is a common convention to indicate that the block parameter is not used in the block.
