# Change Destination and Fruit Checks

Awesome job so far! Let's move forward with a meaningful change to deepen your understanding.

In this task you will be working with a hash that contains information about destinations and their visited status. You will need to modify the code to check if the destination has not been visited using the negation operator.

Before you proceed, let's refresh your understanding of the concept of the negation operator. The negation operator ! is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the negation operator will make it false and vice versa. Here is an example:

```Ruby
a = 5
if !(a > 10)
    puts "a is not greater than 10"
end
```
