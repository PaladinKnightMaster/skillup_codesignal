# Running Basic If Statements

Great job on learning the basics of `if` statements!

Let's run the code you saw in the lesson and observe the output to solidify your understanding.

An `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes the code block inside it if the condition is `true`. If the condition is `false`, the `else` block (if provided) gets executed.

In this practice, we will check if a person has a passport and a valid destination to confirm their travel eligibility. Simply Run the code to see it in action!
