# Using If-Else for Travel Packages

Nice work so far! Now, let's run the code you just learned about and see how it behaves.

Pay close attention to how each condition is checked in sequence. When a matching condition is found, the corresponding message is printed.

Let's break down the code:

- The `age` variable is set to `25`.
- The `if` statement checks if the `age` is less than `18`. If it is, the message "You are eligible for the youth adventure package." is printed.
- If the `age` is not less than `18`, the `elsif` statement checks if the `age` is less than `60`. If it is, the message "You are eligible for the adult adventure package." is printed.
- If the `age` is not less than `60`, the `else` statement prints the message "You are eligible for the senior adventure package."

Run the code below to see the `if-elsif-else` statement in action.
