# Conditional Travel Planning

Nice work so far! Now let's run the code and observe how it behaves.

This will help you understand how conditions using the `>` and `>=` operators work in `if-else` statements.

We will determine trip options based on budget and the urgency of preparation, based on days left until travel.

Run the code to see how each condition is checked and the corresponding message is printed.
