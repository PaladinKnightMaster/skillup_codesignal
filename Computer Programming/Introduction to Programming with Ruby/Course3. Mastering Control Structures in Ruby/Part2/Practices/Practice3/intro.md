# Modifying Age-Based Travel Packages

Great job so far! Let's take it one step further.

Currently, the code determines the appropriate travel package based on three age groups: youth (under 18), adult (18 to 59, both inclusive), and senior (60 and above).

We want you to change this to decide the appropriate travel package based on four age groups: youth (under 18), student (18 to 24, both inclusive), adult (25 to 59, both inclusive), and senior (60 and above).
