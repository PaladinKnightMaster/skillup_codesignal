# Fix the Travel Decision Code

Great job so far! You are doing well.

Now it's time to do some debugging. The code below is supposed to print out a message based on the value of the `score` variable. However, there is a syntax error in the code, which is causing the message "Excellent work!" even when the score is 80. Can you fix the code so that we see the message "Good job!" when the score is 80?
