# Complete Travel Readiness Code

Great job so far! Now, let's fill in the missing parts of our travel planning code.

We need to check if a traveler is ready for their journey. The conditions include having a passport, a visa (if required), and tickets.

Complete the provided code by filling in the missing parts. This will ensure that the checks for `passport`, `tickets`, and `visa` are properly implemented.

Note, that we use the negation operator `!` to check if a visa is required and not obtained.
