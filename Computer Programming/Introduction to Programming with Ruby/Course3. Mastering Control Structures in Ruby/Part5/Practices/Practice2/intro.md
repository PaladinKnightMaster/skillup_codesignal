# Concert Attendance Conditions Explained

Great work on the previous tasks! Now, let's run the code below to further understand how nested conditionals work.

This code involves a concert-goer planning to attend a concert. The conditions for attending depend on factors like having a ticket, being of a certain age, or having parental consent.

Run the code to see how these nested conditionals operate. Pay close attention to the output to understand how the OR (`||`) operator works in this scenario â€“ it allows the concert-goer to attend the concert if they are either 18 years old or above or have parental consent.
