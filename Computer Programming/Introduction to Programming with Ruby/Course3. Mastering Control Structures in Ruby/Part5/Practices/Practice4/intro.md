# Fix the Travel Checklist

Let's identify and fix a bug in the provided code. The code is supposed to handle a complex travel planning scenario involving a passport and a visa. The code should check if the traveler has both a passport and a visa. If the traveler has both, the code should print "Checklist complete!".

However currently, we don't have a visa, but the code is still printing "Checklist complete!". Let's fix this bug to ensure that the code works as expected.
