# Handling Complex Travel Requirements

Great progress so far! Let's run the code you saw in the lesson and pay close attention to the output, as it will help you understand nested conditionals better.

In practical scenarios, decision-making often involves conditions that depend on multiple factors. This code checks if a traveler is ready for their journey based on several criteria: possession of a passport, visa status, and having tickets.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the code:

First, it checks if the traveler has both a passport and tickets.

Next, if the traveler meets the first condition, it further checks if a visa is required and whether it has been obtained.

Based on these checks, it provides appropriate advice or a confirmation message.

Run the code to see how these nested conditionals operate.
