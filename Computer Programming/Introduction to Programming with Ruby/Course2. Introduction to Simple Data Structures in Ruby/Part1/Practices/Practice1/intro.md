# Accessing Elements in Ruby Arrays

Great job on learning how to create and access elements in arrays!

In this practice, you will run the code to see how arrays work in Ruby.

We will create an array of preferred destinations and use various methods to access its elements. Pay close attention to the output to understand how these methods operate.

Remember, here are the key methods we are using:

1. `.first`: Fetches the first element of the array.
2. `.last`: Fetches the last element of the array.
3. Indexing using `[index]`: Retrieves the element at the specified position.
4. `.length`: Returns the number of elements in the array.
Run the code to observe these methods in action.
