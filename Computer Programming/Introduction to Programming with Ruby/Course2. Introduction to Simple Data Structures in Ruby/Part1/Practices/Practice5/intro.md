# Mastering Ruby Array Elements

So far, you've done quite well! Now, let's consolidate what you've learned about arrays in Ruby by writing your own code.

Your task is to write Ruby code that does the following:

1. Create an array called `numbers` with the integers.
2. Access and print the first element in the array.
3. Access and print the last element in the array.
4. Access and print the third element using its index.
5. Print the sum of the first and third elements.

Follow the TODO instructions as your guiding stars!
