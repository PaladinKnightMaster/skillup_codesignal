# Working with Hashes in Ruby

Great job on learning about arrays! Now, let's dive into hashes.

Hashes are very useful when you want to associate keys with values. Here, we'll create a hash, access its values, and add, remove, and update key-value pairs.

Run the following code to see how these operations work:

1. **Create** a hash with countries and their notable cities.
2. **Access** a value using a key.
3. **Add** a new key-value pair.
4. **Remove** a key-value pair.
5. **Update** an existing key-value pair.
6. **Display** the updated hash.
