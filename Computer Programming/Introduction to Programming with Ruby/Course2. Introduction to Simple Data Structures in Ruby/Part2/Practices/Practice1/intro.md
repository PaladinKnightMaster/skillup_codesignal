# Manipulate Array Elements in Ruby

Great job with the lesson! Now, let's run the code to see how adding, removing, and inserting elements in arrays works in practice.

You will see how to:

1. Add elements to the end of the array using the `push` method.

2. Remove elements using the `delete` and `delete_at` methods.

3. Insert elements at specific positions using the `insert` method.
