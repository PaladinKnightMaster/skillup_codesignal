# Manipulate Array Elements in Ruby

You've been doing great so far! This is the final practice of the section, where you will write your own code to manipulate an array of travel destinations by adding, removing, and inserting elements.

Complete the code to:

1. Create an initial array of travel destinations.
2. Add new destinations to the end of the array.
3. Remove a specified destination from the array.
4. Insert a new destination at a specific position.
5. Delete an element at a specified index.
