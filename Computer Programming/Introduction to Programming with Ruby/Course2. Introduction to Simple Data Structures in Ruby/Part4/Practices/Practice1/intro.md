# Practice with Nested Hashes

Great progress so far! Let's solidify your understanding by running the code you saw in the lesson.

In this practice, we will:

1. **Retrieve** and print the city and country for `London Heathrow Airport (LHR)`.

2. **Add** a new airport (Bombay) with additional nested data and print the updated hash.

3. **Update** the country for `Los Angeles Airport (LAX)` and print the result.

4. **Delete** the `Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND)` entry and print the modified hash.

By running this code, you'll see how these operations change the structure and content of the nested hash.
