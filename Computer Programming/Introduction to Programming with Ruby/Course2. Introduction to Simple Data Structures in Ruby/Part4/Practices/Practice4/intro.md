# Hashes in Action: Fill the Blanks

You've done a great job so far! Now let's practice working with nested hashes in a more hands-on way.

Fill in the missing parts of the code to:

1. Print the city and country for London Heathrow Airport (`"LHR"`).
2. Add a new airport (`"BOM"`) with nested data, including an additional field for rating.
3. Update the country for `Los Angeles Airport ("LAX")`.
4. Delete the `Tokyo Haneda Airport ("HND")` entry.
