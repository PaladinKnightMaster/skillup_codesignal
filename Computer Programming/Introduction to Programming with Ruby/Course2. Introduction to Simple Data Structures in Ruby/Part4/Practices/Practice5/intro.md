# Practice Managing Nested Hashes

Nice work so far! Let's wrap up this section by writing the final practice.

In this task, you will:

- Define a hash `book_collection` with keys as book titles and values as nested hashes containing fields for author and year.
- Retrieve and print the author and year for "The Great Gatsby".
- Add a new book (`"The Hobbit"`) with nested data, including a field for rating, and print the updated hash.
- Update the author for `"To Kill a Mockingbird"` to "Harper Lee" and print the result.
- Delete the `"Moby Dick"` entry and print the modified hash.
