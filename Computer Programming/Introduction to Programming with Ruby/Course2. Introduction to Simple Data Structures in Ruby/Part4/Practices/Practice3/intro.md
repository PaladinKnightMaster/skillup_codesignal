# Fix the Hash Code Errors

Great job so far! Now, let's find and fix a bug in the code.

In the code , we have a hash `airport_codes` that contains airport codes as keys and nested hashes as values. We are adding a new airport code, "BOM", with the city "Mumbai" and country "India" to the hash. We then display the city and country of the newly added airport code However, it seems like there is a bug in the code. Can you identify and fix it?
