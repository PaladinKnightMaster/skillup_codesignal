# Change Travel Cities

You're doing great! Let's make a small change to our existing code.

Currently the code contains hardcoded values. Hardcoding means directly providing the values in the code â€“ we are dicreclty printing values "Los Angeles" and "Tokyo".

Instead of hardcoding, we can use variables to store these values. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

Run the code after making the changes.
