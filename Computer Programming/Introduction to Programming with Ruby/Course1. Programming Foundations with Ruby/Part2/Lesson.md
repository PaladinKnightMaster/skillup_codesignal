# Ruby Basics - Introduction to Variables

## Welcome to Ruby Basics: Introduction to Variables
Welcome back! Now that you've successfully written your first Ruby script, it’s time to build on that by exploring the fundamental concept of **variables**. Understanding variables is a key step in your programming journey. Today, we'll delve into how to create and use variables in Ruby, setting you up for more complex and dynamic coding tasks.

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, we will cover:

1. **Creating Variables**: You'll learn how to declare variables and assign values to them.
2. **Displaying Variables**: We'll explore how to use the `puts` function to display the value of variables.
3. **String Variables**: Understanding the difference between double quotes (`" "`) and single quotes (`' '`).

Let's start with an example to get a sense of what this looks like in Ruby:

```Ruby
# The theme for this lesson is "Adventure".
# We'll create a variable for our starting point.
starting_point = "New York"

# Display the starting point using Ruby's puts function
puts starting_point

# Another string with ' '  representing destination
destination = 'Paris'

puts destination
```

In this example, we've created two variables: `starting_point` and `destination`. We've assigned them values of `"New York"` and `'Paris'`, respectively. We then used the `puts` function to display the values of these variables.

Notice that we used double quotes (`" "`) for the `starting_point` variable and single quotes (`' '`) for the `destination` variable, and both are valid ways to define strings in Ruby. Later in the course, we'll explore the differences between these two approaches.

## Why It Matters
Variables are like containers that store data values. They are fundamental in making your programs flexible and dynamic. By learning how to use variables, you can begin to write more complex programs that can solve real-world problems involving data processing, user input, and more.

For instance, consider planning an adventure where different variables store different pieces of information, like the starting point of your journey or the names of cities you'll visit. By being able to assign and manipulate these values, your program becomes far more powerful and useful.

Equipped with this knowledge, you will find it easier to understand more advanced topics later on. Plus, mastering the use of variables is crucial for debugging and managing your code efficiently.
