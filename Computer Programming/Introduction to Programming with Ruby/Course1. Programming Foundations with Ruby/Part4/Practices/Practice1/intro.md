# String Interpolation in Practice

Great job on learning string interpolation and operations!

Now, let's run a script to see these concepts in action. This will help you understand how to use variables and string interpolation to produce dynamic outputs.

**String interpolation** in Ruby allows you to include variable values directly within a string using the `#{}` syntax. This makes it easier to create complex messages without manually concatenating strings and variables.

Here's a simple example:

```Ruby
name = "Alice"
age = 30
puts "Hello, my name is #{name} and I am #{age} years old."
