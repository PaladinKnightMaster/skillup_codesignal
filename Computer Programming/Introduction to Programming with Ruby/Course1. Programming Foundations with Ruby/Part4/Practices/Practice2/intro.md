# Calculating Trip Costs Efficiently

Let's build on what you have learned so far.

Currently, the script prints the remaining number of days for an adventure. Let's modify this code to also print the average spending per day. This will give a clearer picture of the trip costs.

Before you start, let's explore the division operator in Ruby. The division operator `/` in Ruby returns the quotient of the division operation. For example, `10 / 3` will return `3`. We can use this operator for dividing number literals or variables that hold numbers as follows:

```Ruby
# Division of the number of literals
x = 10 / 3
puts x # Output: 3

# Division of variables
a = 12
b = 3
y = a / b
puts y # Output: 4
```

With this information in mind, complete the code to print the average daily spending.
