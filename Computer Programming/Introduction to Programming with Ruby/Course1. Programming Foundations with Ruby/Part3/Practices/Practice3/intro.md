# Fix the Adventure Script

Great job on the previous task! Now, let's try to identify and fix a bug. You're given a Ruby script that is supposed to calculate the total number of days spent in different locations during an adventure.

The script declares the number of days spent in India, Thailand, and Egypt, and then calculates the total number of days spent in all locations. Can you recall how the numbers are declared in Ruby? We use integers, right, like `myVariable = 1`?

It seems there is a mistake in the script, as the person who wrote it didn't know how to declare numbers in Ruby. Can you identify the bug and fix it?
