# Calculate Total Days of Adventure

Great job on the previous tasks!

Now let's write a script from scratch to calculate the average number of days you will spend on an adventure to different iconic cities. But before we get into the task, let's understand the importance of using floating-point numbers (floats). Floating-point numbers are useful when you need more precise calculations. Consider the value of π (pi), which is approximately `3.14159`. Using an integer to represent π would be inaccurate, but using a float allows for greater precision: `pi = 3.14159`.

When you divide numbers in Ruby, using an integer gives an integer result, while using a float gives a more precise result. For example:

* `5 / 2` will give you `2` (an integer division).
* `5 / 2.0` will give you `2.5` (a float division).

In this task, we need to calculate the average days spent in each city, and using floats will provide a more accurate result.
