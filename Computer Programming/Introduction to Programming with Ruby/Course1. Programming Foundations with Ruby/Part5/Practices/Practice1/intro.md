# Adventure Ready with Booleans

Excellent! You've learned about booleans and their importance in making decisions in your programs. Now, let's run the code from the lesson to see it in action.

Booleans can be either `true` or `false`, and they indicate the state of a condition.

Here is the code:

1. **Setting up conditions**: You define two destinations.
2. **Setting status flags**: You use boolean variables to represent whether the destinations have been visited.
3. **Outputting the status**: You print statements to show if the destinations have been visited.

Run this code and observe the output. This will help reinforce your understanding of boolean values.
