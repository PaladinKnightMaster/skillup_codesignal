# Comparing Values with New Operators

Nice work so far! Now, let's build on what we've learned.

In Ruby, comparisons to check if a value is greater than or equal to another value are done using the `>=` operator. Similarly, to check if a value is less than or equal to another value, the `<=` operator is used. Both operators return a boolean value: `true` if the comparison holds, and `false` otherwise.

Modify the code to have two new comparisons to check if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Follow the TODO instructions for more details.

Update the code to reflect these new comparisons.
