# Comparison Operators in Action

Great job so far! Let's run the code you saw in the lesson and pay careful attention to the output. This will help you better understand how comparison operators and boolean expressions work.

In this specific practice, we will check if `a` is equal to `b`, if `a` is less than `b`, if `a` is greater than `b`, and if `a` is not equal to `b`.

This should give you a solid understanding of how to use comparison operators in Ruby.
