# Mountain Heights Comparison with Ruby

Excellent progress so far! Now it's time to put your knowledge into action. Imagine you need to compare the altitudes of two different mountains. We want to create a Ruby script that compares the heights of two mountains and prints out various comparison results.

Here's what you need to do:

- Assign the height of **Mount Kilimanjaro** to the variable `height_kilimanjaro`.
- Assign the height of **Mount Denali** to the variable `height_denali`.
- Create boolean variables to store the results of comparison operations:
    - `is_equal`: Check if the heights are equal.
    - `kilimanjaro_higher`: Check if Kilimanjaro's height is greater.
    - `denali_higher`: Check if Denali's height is greater.
    - `different_height`: Check if the heights are different.

Print out the results using `puts`.
