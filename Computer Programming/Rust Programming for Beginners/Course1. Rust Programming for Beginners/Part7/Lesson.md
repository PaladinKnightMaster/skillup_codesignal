# Navigating Rust Control Structures: Conditional Voyage Through Code

## Charting Our Coding Journey: Overview of Control Structures in Rust
Hello again, Rustonaut! Today, we're unraveling the mysteries of an essential programming tool: control structures. They guide the flow of our program. Are you ready to delve into `if-else` statements and `match` statements?

## If and If-Else Structure
The structure of an `if` and `if-else` construct in Rust follows this format:

```rust
if condition {
    // action if condition is true
}

if condition {
    // action if condition is true
} else {
    // action if condition is false
}
```
When the provided `condition` is `true`, we execute the block within the `if` clause. When the `condition` is `false`, we enter an optional `else` block.

## Navigating the Expanse of Rust's If-Else Statement
An `if` statement is simplistic yet powerful. It instructs the compiler to execute actions only under specific conditions. Let's imagine we're checking a planet's atmospheric composition:

```rust
let oxygen_level = 78; // The oxygen level on the planet

if oxygen_level > 20 {
    println!("Planet has breathable air!"); // Suitable oxygen_level
} else {
    println!("Oxygen level too low!"); // Oxygen level is insufficient
}
// The code prints: Planet has breathable air!
```
In the example above, the statement `if oxygen_level > 20` checks if the oxygen level is above 20. If the condition proves `true`, it prints `"Planet has breathable air!"`. If it is `false`, the `else` statement provides an alternative command, printing `"Oxygen level too low!"`.

## Multiple Conditions: Else If Statement
To handle multiple conditions, we utilize `else if`:

```rust
let oxygen_level = 58;
if oxygen_level > 70 {
    println!("Excellent Oxygen level!");
} else if oxygen_level > 50 {
    println!("Oxygen level is acceptable.");
} else {
    println!("Oxygen level is too low!");
}
// The code prints: Oxygen level is acceptable.
```
The `else if` keyword provides alternative paths until the correct one is met, allowing us to respond appropriately to different atmospheric conditions. When the first condition is met, Rust ignores all remaining `else if` conditions.

## Traversing the Cosmos with Rust's Match Statement
A `match` statement in Rust enables us to navigate multiple outcomes based on a variable's value. Let's suppose we're journeying to different planets and each requires different preparations:

```rust
let planet_number = 3; // The selected planet number

match planet_number {
    1 => println!("Gearing up for Planet 1!"), // Case for planet 1
    2 => println!("Preparing for Planet 2!"), // Case for planet 2
    3 => println!("Get ready for Planet 3!"), // Case for planet 3
    _ => println!("Resting at the spaceship."), // Default case
}
// The code prints: Get ready for Planet 3!
```
In this code, each `match` arm corresponds to a planet number. The `_` in the last arm is a catch-all pattern that matches any value. Every `match` statement must end with a `_` arm.
