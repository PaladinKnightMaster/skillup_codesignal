# Rust Variables and Constants: Speed of Light and Moons Counter

Prepare for an astronomical Rust adventure! Enhance your understanding of Rust by implementing constants and mutable variables in a space exploration setting. Define a constant for the speed of light in a vacuum and a mutable variable for cataloging lunar discoveries. Initially, set the number of moons, then update the count as new moons are discovered. Present both figures to mission control. Launch sequence initiated!
