# Temperature Conversion in Rust

Explore the explicit type casting in Rust by converting a temperature from Celsius (`f32`) to Fahrenheit (`f64`). Run the provided code to observe how Rust handles different floating-point types during calculations. This practice task demonstrates manual type casting before performing arithmetic operations.
