# Mastering Rust Type Conversion

## Topic Overview
Greetings, budding Rustaceans! Are you ready to delve into some fundamental knowledge about Rust? Today's journey will take us into the heart of the Rust language: **Data Type Conversion**. Often, we need to convert one data type to another for a different representation in our programs, much like translating alien languages in a Sci-Fi adventure. We'll focus on both automatic and explicit conversions, as well as potential pitfalls. So, fasten your seatbelts, and let's dive in!

## Automatic (Implicit) Conversions
In Rust, unlike some other languages, automatic conversion of types isn't allowed. This restriction stems from Rust's focus on type safety, put in place to avoid unintended consequences of type conversion that may lead to bugs in the software.

Rust doesn't automatically treat an `i32` (integer) as an `f64` (floating point), or vice versa. Here's what happens when you attempt to do so:

```rust
let i: i32 = 10;  // an integer
let d: f64 = i;  // error: expected `f64`, found `i32`
```
Rust will throw a compile-time error stating it expected a `f64` but found an `i32` instead.

## Manual (Explicit) Conversions
To convert between types in Rust, we must manually specify the conversion. This requirement is akin to a human (symbolizing `f64`) trying to fit into space suit designed for space dog (`i32`). We must explicitly modify the space dog suit to be human sized.

Here's how to convert an `i32` to a `f64`:

```rust
let i: i32 = 10;  // an integer
let d: f64 = i as f64;  // explicit conversion to f64

println!("The value of d: {}", d);   // Output: The value of d: 10
```
And here's how to convert from a `f64` to an `i32`:

```rust
let d: f64 = 10.75; // a f64 number
let i: i32 = d as i32;  // casting the double to int

println!("The value of i: {}", i);  // Output: The value of i: 10
```
Notice that the decimal part of `10.75` gets truncated during the conversion process, leaving only `10`.

## Type Safety in Arithmetic Operations
In Rust, strict type safety rules extend to arithmetic operations as well. This means that Rust doesn't implicitly convert types for addition or other arithmetic operations.

For example, it's invalid to add an `i32` value to an `f32` value. You might expect this to work because it seems reasonable to add integers and floating-point numbers. However, for the purpose of safeguarding type safety, Rust disallows this operation. Here's what happens when you try to add variables of types `i32` and `f32`:

```rust
let a: i32 = 10;    // an integer
let b: f32 = 10.5;  // a floating point number

let c = a + b;     // error: expected `f32`, found `i32`
```
Rust will throw a compile-time error, stating that it expected an `f32` but found an `i32` instead. This is because Rust can't automatically convert `a` from `i32` to `f32` to make the addition possible.

If you intend to perform this operation, you must explicitly convert the `i32` value to an `f32` value like so:

```rust
let a: i32 = 10;     // an integer
let b: f32 = 10.5;  // a floating point number

let c = a as f32 + b;     // explicit conversion of `a` to `f32`
println!("The value of c: {}", c); // prints "The value of c: 20.5"
```
Now, `c` will hold the value `20.5`, as expected. This explicitness of conversions is a part of Rust's dedication to preventing bugs and easing debugging, even though it may require a bit more code.

## Converting to and from Strings
A common type of conversion in Rust programming involves the `String` type. This conversion includes turning numbers into strings for output, and vice versa.

```rust
let ten: i32 = 10; // an integer with the value 10
let ten_string: String = ten.to_string(); // A string with the value "10"
println!("The value of ten_string: {}", ten_string);    // Output: The value of ten_string: 10

let twenty_five_string = "25";
let twenty_five: i32 = twenty_five_string.parse().unwrap();
println!("The value of twenty_five: {}", twenty_five);    // Output: The value of twenty_five: 25

let invalid_number = "25abc";
let number: i32 = invalid_number.parse().unwrap(); // Oops! This will panic, "25abc" is not a number!
```
In the conversion to `String`, we use the `to_string()` method on an `i32` value.

In Rust, `.parse()` and `.unwrap()` are methods commonly used for type conversion and error handling, respectively:

`.parse()` attempts to convert a string into some other type. It returns a `Result` type, which is an either Ok (if the operation was successful) or `Err` (if the operation failed).

`.unwrap()` is used on the `Result` type variable. If the `Result` is `Ok`, `.unwrap()` will return the value inside the `Ok`. However, if the `Result` is `Err`, `.unwrap()` will raise and error and stop the code.
