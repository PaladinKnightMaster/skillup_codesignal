# Polymorphism with Video Games

You have made excellent progress in understanding Rust traits and polymorphism. Now, let's put that knowledge to use.

For the final Rust practice, you will write a program that utilizes polymorphism for two different video game characters. You will create a `Warrior` and `Mage` struct that both implement the `Character` trait. In addition, you will write a generic function `get_strength` that accepts both `Warrior` and `Mage` characters as inputs.
