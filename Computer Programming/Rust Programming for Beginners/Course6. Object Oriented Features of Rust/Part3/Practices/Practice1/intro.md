# Bank Account Module Encapsulation

Nice work on understanding modules and encapsulation! Now, let's see these concepts in action with a practical example.

In this practice task, you'll run code that demonstrates how to create a `BankAccount` module with encapsulated methods.

Here's what the code does:

* Defines a `BankAccount` struct within the `bank` module.
* Implements methods (`new`, `deposit`, `get_balance`, and `withdraw`) for `BankAccount`.
* Demonstrates usage in the `main` function.

Run the code to see how the bank account operations work!
