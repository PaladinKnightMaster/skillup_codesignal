# Implementing Methods for Traits

For this task, you need to define and implement methods for calculating the area and perimeter of certain shapes. The starter code already defines the `Shape` trait. Now, implement these traits for the `Triangle` and `Rectangle` structs.

Remember

* The area of a triangle is `0.5 * base * height`.
* The area of a rectangle is `length * width`.
* The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the length of the sides
* The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width)
