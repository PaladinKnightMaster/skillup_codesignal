# Methods in Spacecraft Structs

Nice progress on understanding methods and constructors in Rust! Let's apply what you've learned. The code defines a `Starship` struct with fields `name` and `speed`. The struct implements a `travel_time` method and a `change_speed` method.

Your task is to add a constructor `new` to initialize a `Starship` and create an instance of it in the `main` function. Follow the TODO's to complete the code.
