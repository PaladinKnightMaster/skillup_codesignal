# Implement a Game Character

Great job so far! Now it's time to demonstrate your understanding by implementing a `GameCharacter` struct from scratch.

Your task is to:

1. Define a struct `GameCharacter` with fields `name` and `level`.

2. Implement an associated function to construct a `GameCharacter`.

3. Create methods for the `GameCharacter`:

    * `attack` to calculate the damage done by an attack given a move_power
    * `level_up` to increase the character's level.

Implement the functionalities as outlined and run your code.
