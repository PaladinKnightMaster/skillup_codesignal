# Employee Management Methods

Great job understanding the role of methods in Rust. Now, let's solidify this knowledge by running some code.

In this task, we've defined an `Employee` struct with fields for `employee_id` and `salary`. We then implement methods for this struct:

* A `calculate_tax` method to return the tax based on a certain tax rate.
* An `update_salary` method to set the employee's salary to a new value.
* A `new` constructor to initialize an `Employee`.

Run the code to see:

1. The implementation of methods for an `Employee` struct.
2. How to calculate the tax for an employee.
3. How to update the employee's salary.
4. The creation of an instance using the constructor method and calling the implemented methods.
