# Creating and Updating Movie Structs

You've practiced defining and using structs in Rust. Now, let's build a complete Rust program involving structs.

Your task is to create a Rust program that:

1. Defines a `Movie` struct with fields: `title`, `director`, and `duration`.
2. Creates an instance of `Movie` with specific values.
3. Prints the values of the fields.
4. Change the value of the director field and print the updated value.

Follow the `TODO` comments in the starter code to complete the task.
