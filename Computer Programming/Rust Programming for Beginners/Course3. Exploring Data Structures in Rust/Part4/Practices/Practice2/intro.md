# Managing Movie Collections with HashSets

Awesome progress! Now let's delve deeper into using `HashSets` in Rust.

In this exercise, you will explore how ownership and borrowing work with `HashSets`.

* **Ownership and Borrowing**: Adding items to a `HashSet` transfers their ownership. `HashSets` can be passed to functions either by reference or by value.
In this example:

* We create a `HashSet` and explore what happens when we try to print a value after adding it to the set.
* We pass the `HashSet` to functions by reference and by value.
