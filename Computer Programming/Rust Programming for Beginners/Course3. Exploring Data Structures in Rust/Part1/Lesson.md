# Tuples in Rust

## Introduction to Tuples in Rust
Hello! Today, we will explore a unique and powerful data structure in the Rust programming language — **tuples**. As we dive into tuples, we'll understand their characteristics, how to create and manipulate them, and their applications.

Tuples in Rust let us group together values of different data types into a single compound. They are especially useful when you want to work with heterogeneous data without relying on complex data structures. Imagine you need to store a person's name, age, and height together. A tuple is an ideal candidate for this scenario.

Let's get started!

## Creating Tuples
There are two ways to declare tuples in Rust. To declare a tuple with explicit data types, add the data type in parentheses, separated by commas. The values for each element in the tuple must match these explicitly declared data types. Rust can also infer the data types, eliminating the need to explicitly declare data types.

Here is an example of how to create tuples in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Creating Tuple with Data Type
    let person_with_type: (&str, i32, f64) = ("Alice", 30, 5.5);

    // Creating Tuple without Data Type
    let person_without_type = ("Bob", 25, 6.0);
}
```
In this example, we created two tuples: `person_with_type` has explicit data types for its elements, while `person_without_type` relies on type inference.

## Accessing Elements of a Tuple
In Rust, you can access the elements of a tuple using index notation. Tuples are zero-indexed meaning the first element of the tuple is at index 0. To access the value of a tuple, use the tuple name, followed by a dot, then the index number. Here’s how you can do it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = ("Alice", 30, 5.5);
    // Accessing elements using index notation
    let name = person.0;
    let age = person.1;
    let height = person.2;
    println!("Name: {}", name);  // Prints: Name: Alice
    println!("Age: {}", age);    // Prints: Age: 30
    println!("Height: {}", height); // Prints: Height: 5.5
}
```
In this example:

* `person.0` accesses the first element of the tuple, which is `"Alice"`.
* `person.1` accesses the second element of the tuple, which is `30`.
* `person.2` accesses the third element of the tuple, which is `5.5`.

## Deconstructing Tuples
Rust allows us to deconstruct tuples to separate their elements for easier manipulation. To deconstruct a tuple, place the variable names in parentheses, followed by `=` then the tuple variable name. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = ("Alice", 30, 5.5);
    let (name, age, height) = person;
    println!("Name: {}", name);  // Prints: Name: Alice
    println!("Age: {}", age);    // Prints: Age: 30
    println!("Height: {}", height); // Prints: Height: 5.5
}
```
In this code, we deconstructed the tuple `person` into variables `name`, `age`, and `height`.

Deconstructing tuples is helpful when you need to work with each element individually.

## Mutable Tuples
In Rust, tuples are by default immutable. Using the `mut` keyword, we can modify the elements of a tuple. Keep in mind the data type of new values must be the same as the original value.

To print the values of a tuple, we use `{:?}` in the `println` statement. Let's take a look:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut person = ("Charlie", 28, 5.8);
    println!("Before modification: {:?}", person); // Prints: ("Charlie", 28, 5.8)
    person.1 = 29; // Modifying the age
    println!("After modification: {:?}", person); // Prints: ("Charlie", 29, 5.8)
}
```
In this code, we created a mutable tuple `person` then modified the second element using `person.1 = 29`.

## Ownership with Tuples
Understanding how Rust manages data copying and ownership within tuples is crucial. Recall, copy data types create a copy of the variable and do not transfer ownership. Non-copy data types move ownership of the data to the new variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tuple_with_copy = (42, "Hello".to_string());
    let (num, text) = tuple_with_copy;
    println!("Copy data in tuple - num: {}", tuple_with_copy.0); // Prints: "Copy data in tuple - num: 42"
    println!("Moved data is {}", tuple_with_copy.1); // Ownership of "Hello" has changed, so this line causes an error.
}
```
Here:

* We created a tuple with an integer (`i32`) and a `String`.
* When deconstructing, num (`i32`) is copied because integers implement the `Copy` trait.
* The `String` is moved, and `text` now owns it.

## Tuples as Function Parameters
Tuples can be passed to functions, enabling us to bundle multiple elements as a single argument. If all elements within a tuple implement the Copy trait, the tuple itself can be copied. The rules for passing tuples as function parameters are:

* Passing a reference to a tuple does not transfer ownership
* If all elements within a tuple implement the Copy trait, the tuple will not transfer ownership when passed to a function without using a reference.
* If at least one element in the tuple is a non-copy type, ownership is transferred when the tuple is passed to a function without using a reference.
```rust
fn main() {
    let non_copy_tuple = (10, String::from("I am not copy"));
    display_tuple_reference(&non_copy_tuple);
    println!("After display_tuple_reference: ({}, {})", non_copy_tuple.0, non_copy_tuple.1); // Prints: After display_tuple_reference: (10, I am not copy)

    let copyable_tuple = (10, 20);
    display_tuple_copy(copyable_tuple);
    println!("After display_tuple_copy: ({}, {})", copyable_tuple.0, copyable_tuple.1); // Prints: After display_tuple_copy: (10, 20)

    display_tuple_ownership(non_copy_tuple);
    // println!("After display_tuple_ownership: ({}, {})", non_copy_tuple.0, non_copy_tuple.1); // Causes error
}

fn display_tuple_reference(tuple: &(i32, String)) {
    println!("In display_tuple_reference: ({}, {})", tuple.0, tuple.1); // Prints: In display_tuple_reference: (10, I am not copy)
}

fn display_tuple_copy(tuple: (i32, i32)) {
    println!("In display_tuple_copy: ({}, {})", tuple.0, tuple.1); // Prints: In display_tuple_copy: (10, 20)
}

fn display_tuple_ownership(tuple: (i32, String)) {
    println!("In display_tuple_ownership: ({}, {})", tuple.0, tuple.1); // Prints: In display_tuple_ownership: (10, I am not copy)
}
```
In this code:

* The function `display_tuple_reference` takes a reference to a tuple with elements `(i32, String)`. Referencing allows the function to read the tuple without taking ownership of its data, so it remains available in the main function.

* The function `display_tuple_copy` takes a tuple with two `i32` elements. Since `i32` implements the `Copy` trait, the data is copied when passed to the function.

* The function `display_tuple_ownership` takes ownership of a tuple with elements `(i32, String)`. This consumes the tuple, making it unavailable for further use in the main function. Uncommenting the last `println!` statement in `main` causes an error because the tuple's ownership has been moved to the function.

## println! Refresher
Recall, `println!` does not affect ownership of a variable in Rust. When you pass a value to `println!`, it borrows the value immutably just for the duration of the macro call. This means that after the `println!` call, the ownership of the value remains unchanged, and you can continue to use the variable as before.

```rust
fn main() {
    let non_copy_tuple = (10, String::from("Hello"));
    println!("Ownership of {} does not change when using println!", non_copy_tuple.1);
    let hello = non_copy_tuple.1; // Valid since println! does not transfer ownership.
}
```
