# Mastering Variable Shadowing and Scope in Rust Functions

## Introduction
Welcome to our exploration of **Variable Shadowing and Scope in Rust!** Today, we'll be learning these fundamental principles through clear explanations and practical examples, which will make our journey through Rust functions both interesting and efficient. So, fasten your seatbelts!

## Variable Shadowing
In Rust, variable shadowing is a unique feature that allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. The new variable "shadows" the previous one, replacing the value of variable being "shadowed". This helps when you need to change the type of a variable or want to modify a variable but still use it immutably.

Let's consider the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;

    let true_value: bool = true;
    let true_value = "True";
}
```
In this example, `x` is initially declared as holding the value `5`. Subsequently, we declare `x` again, inferring that `x` now holds the result of `x + 1`. Importantly, the shadowed `x` retains its immutability.

In another example, `true_value` is declared as a boolean holding `true`. Then, we shadow `true_value` and change its datatype to become a string, holding `"True"`.

Shadowing enables us to perform transformations on values while maintaining immutability and even changing types if necessary. Although it bears some resemblance to variable mutation, they are fundamentally different as shadowing involves creating a new variable.

Variable shadowing requires redeclaring the variable again with the `let` keyword. If you do not use the `let` keyword, the Rust compiler will throw an error. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    x = x + 1; // Causes error because x is immutable

    let mut true_value: bool = true;
    true_value = "True"; // Causes error because true_value must be of type bool
}
```
First, an immutable variable `x` is declared and initialized with the value `5`. The next line attempts to change the value of `x` by assigning it the result of `x + 1`. This is not possible because in Rust, an immutable variable's value cannot be altered once it's been initialized.

Next, `true_value` is declared as a mutable boolean variable set as true. The next line tries to assign `"True"`, a string, to `true_value`. This is incorrect because, in Rust, even mutable variables cannot change their type after declaration. `true_value` maintains its initial boolean type and cannot be assigned a string value.

## Understanding Variable Scope
Programming involves using variables to store data. Every variable exists within a scope â€” a region where the variable is valid and can be accessed. In Rust, we can create a new scope using the`{}` braces, forming what we commonly refer to as "code blocks". Let's examine examples to make this clearer:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 8; // `x` is in scope for the entire function

    {
        let y = 5; // `y` is in scope only within this inner block
        println!("x is in scope and has a value of {}", x); // Prints: x is in scope and has a value of 8
        println!("y is in scope and has a value of {}", y); // Prints: y is in scope and has a value of 5
    }

    println!("x is still in scope and has a value of {}", x); // Prints: x is still in scope and has a value of 8
    println!("{}", y); // Compiler error because `y` is out of scope here
}
```
In the above example, `x` is within a valid range throughout the `main` function, but `y` is only in scope within the inner block in which it's declared.

## Variable Scope and Shadowing
In Rust, apart from defining the variable scope, you can also use variable shadowing within different scopes. Shadowing lets you reuse variable names and apply transformations to values, ensuring code clarity while fullfilling different needs in each scope. Let's explore further with two examples:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 8; // `x` is in scope for the entire function

    {
        let y = 5; // `y` is in scope only within this inner block
        let x = 3;
        println!("The new x is in this scope and has a value of {}", x); // Prints: The new x is in this scope and has a value of 3

        println!("y is in scope and has a value of {}", y); // Prints: y is in scope and has a value of 5
    }

    println!("The value of x is still {} in this scope.", x); // Prints: The value of x is still 8 in this scope.
}
```
In this code, `x` is first initialized with the value `8` and it stays in scope throughout the `main` function. Inside the inner block, `y` is declared with the value `5` and `x` is redeclared with the value `3`. This is a classic example of shadowing; `x` in the inner scope shadows `x` in the outer scope. But this doesn't affect the value of `x` in the outer scope; it is still `8`, as proved by the last `println!` statement.

Let's consider the effect of attempting to modify `x` in an inner scope when it's mutable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 8; // `x` is in scope for the entire function

    {
        let y = 5; // `y` is in scope only within this inner block
        x = 3;
        println!("x is {} in this scope.", x); // Prints: x is 3 in this scope.
        println!("y is in scope and has a value of {}", y); // Prints: y is in scope and has a value of 5
    }

    println!("The value of x is {} in this scope.", x); // Prints: The value of x is 3 in this scope.
}
```
In this example, `x` is declared as mutable in the outer scope with a value of `8`. Inside the inner block, `x` is simply reassigned the value `3`, without redeclaration. There's no shadowing in this case. So, the operation affects `x`'s value in the outer scope as well; the last `println!` shows us that `x` now equals `3`.

This demonstrates the difference between variable shadowing and variable mutation in different scopes in Rust.

## Variable Scope in Functions
In Rust, each function has its own scope. When passing variables between functions, Rust always creates a separate copy or a reference to the original variable in the new scope. This protects the variable's original value in its initial scope, unless explicitly modified. Let's understand this with two examples:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 8; // `x` is in scope for the entire function

    add_one(x); // Prints: Inside add_one, x = 9

    println!("The value of x is still {}", x); // Prints: The value of x is still 8
}

fn add_one(x: i32) {
    let x = x+1;
    println!("Inside add_one, x = {}", x);
}
```
In this first example, `x` is initialized to `8` in `main()`. The function `add_one()` is then called with `x` as the argument, which shadows the `x` inside `add_one()`. However, because `add_one()` has its own scope, this doesn't affect `x` in `main()`. Thus, after the function call, `x` remains `8`.

Now, let's see what happens if we modify `x` explicitly:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 8; // `x` is in scope for the entire function

    x = add_one(x);

    println!("The value of x is now {}", x); // Prints: The value of x is now 9
}

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let x = x+1;
    x
}
```
In this second example, we're explicitly updating the value of `x` in `main()` with the value returned by `add_one()`. Inside the function `add_one()`, `x` is incremented by `1` and returned to the caller. This updated value is then assigned to `x` in `main()`. Therefore, after the function call, `x` now equals `9`.

These examples illustrate the rules of variable scope when passing values between functions in Rust. The function's own scope protects the original value of a variable in the caller function unless we explicitly update it.
