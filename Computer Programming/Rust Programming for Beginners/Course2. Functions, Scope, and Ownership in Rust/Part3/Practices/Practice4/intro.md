# Interior Designer: Changing Wall Colors in Rust

Wrap up your journey on mutable references by taking the role of an interior designer! Your task is to write a function that transforms the **color of walls**. Follow the Rust syntax to define a mutable variable, pass it to a function by mutable reference, and update its value inside. Showcase the change by printing the new color.
