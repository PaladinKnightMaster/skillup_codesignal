# SInspecting Super Powers

In this task, you have a list of superhero powers. Your task is to use a `while` loop, to print the powers in reverse order.

Note: The `len` method returns a `usize` data type. This means this variable is unsigned and must never become a negative number. Ensure any `usize` variables do not become negative.
