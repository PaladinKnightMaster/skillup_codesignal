# Iterators and Enumerators in Rust

## Introduction to Iterators and Enumerators in Rust
Hello! In this lesson, we are going to explore a fundamental aspect of Rust programming: **Iterators and Enumerators**. Iterators are an essential tool in Rust, allowing you to traverse sequences of data efficiently. They offer a convenient and idiomatic way to manipulate collections.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be proficient in iterating over arrays, vectors, strings, and hash maps. We'll break down each topic into understandable and practical steps, so you can follow along and implement them in your own code seamlessly.

Let's dive in!

## Introducing `iter`
Before we delve into specific examples of iterating over various types of collections, let's first introduce two fundamental methods in Rust: `iter` and `enumerate`.

The `iter` method is commonly used to create an iterator from a collection. This method is available for arrays, vectors, and hash maps, allowing you to traverse through them element by element.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Using `iter` to get an iterator over the array
    for value in numbers.iter() {
        println!("Value: {}", value);
    }
}
/* Output:
    Value: 1
    Value: 2
    Value: 3
    Value: 4
    Value: 5
*/
```
The code `for value in numbers.iter()` uses the `iter` method to create an iterator over the array numbers. The `for` loop then iterates over each element. Within the loop, each element (referred to as `value`) is printed. For each iteration, the placeholder {} is replaced with the current value.

## Pairing `iter` and `enumerate`
The `enumerate` method builds upon the base iterator to provide a sequence of pairs, where each pair consists of an index and a reference to the value at that index. This is particularly useful when you need to keep track of the position of each item within the collection. Let's take a look.

```Rust
fn main() {
    // Defining an array
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Using `iter().enumerate()` on the array
    for (index, value) in numbers.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Index: {}, Value: {}", index, value);
    }
}
/* Output
    Index: 0, Value: 1
    Index: 1, Value: 2
    Index: 2, Value: 3
    Index: 3, Value: 4
    Index: 4, Value: 5
*/
```
`for (index, value) in numbers.iter().enumerate()` uses both the `iter` and `enumerate` methods. `iter` creates an iterator over the array, and `enumerate` transforms this iterator into one that yields pairs of `(index, value)`, where index is the position of the element in the array and value is the reference to the element.

## Iterating Over a Vector
Vectors are similar to arrays, but their size can change dynamically. They are more flexible for most situations that involve collections. The syntax for `iter` and `enumerate` are the same for both vectors and arrays.

```Rust
fn main() {
    // Defining a vector
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Iterating over the vector using .iter()
    for value in vec.iter() {
        println!("{}", value);
    }

    // Iterating with enumeration to access indices
    for (index, value) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Index: {}, Value: {}", index, value); // Prints index and value pairs
    }
}
```

## Iterating Over a String
For string data types, we use `.chars()` to iterate over each character in a string.

```Rust
fn main() {
    // Defining a string slice
    let s = "hello";

    // Iterating over the string using .chars()
    for ch in s.chars() {
        println!("{}", ch); // Prints each character on a new line
    }
}
```
To access both the index and character of each element, use `.chars().enumerate()`

```Rust
fn main() {
    let s = "rust";
    // Iterating with enumeration to access indices
    for (index, ch) in s.chars().enumerate() {
        println!("Index: {}, Char: {}", index, ch);
    }
}
/* Output
    Index: 0, Char: r
    Index: 1, Char: u
    Index: 2, Char: s
    Index: 3, Char: t
*/
```

## Iterating Over a HashMap
HashMaps store key-value pairs and provide efficient lookup. There are two ways to iterate over the key/value pairs of a HashMap. Rust's standard library offers the `.iter()` method to iterate over these pairs. In addition, you can pass a reference to the HashMap, and Rust automatically calls the `iter` method on the reference. HashMaps are unordered collections, so the order in which key/value pairs are iterated over is not guaranteed.

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {

    // Defining a HashMap
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("a", 1);
    map.insert("b", 2);
    map.insert("c", 3);

    // Iterating over the HashMap using iter
    println!("Iterating over a HashMap:");
    for (key, value) in map.iter() {
        println!("Key: {}, Value: {}", key, value);
    }

    // Iterating over the HashMap using reference
    for (key, value) in &map {
        println!("Key: {}, Value: {}", key, value);
    }
}
/* Possible Outputs for Each Loop
    Key: a, Value: 1
    Key: b, Value: 2
    Key: c, Value: 3
*/
```
The outputs might differ in the order elements are printed since HashMaps are unordered collections.
