# Charting the Stars: Update the useEffect Hook

Stellar Navigator, you've found yourself gazing at the stars! Let's modify our effect so that it runs whenever the `starsCounted` value changes and not only in the beginning. Update the dependency array in `useEffect` to reflect this change. Remember, this modification will log a message every time you count a new star!
