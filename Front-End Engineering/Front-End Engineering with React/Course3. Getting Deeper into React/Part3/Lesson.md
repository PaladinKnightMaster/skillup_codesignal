# Diving into React: Managing and Splitting Complex State in Functional Components

## Overview and Introduction
Welcome aboard! Today, we're diving deep into an essential topic in React: managing complex state and splitting state in functional components. This technique is fundamental for building scalable applications. Before exploring this topic, let's briefly understand the characteristics of React.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications that require a fast and interactive user experience. One of the key characteristics of React is its component architecture. Components are reusable pieces of code that individually manage their state, implementation, and rendering. They facilitate code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns.

Now, focusing on our primary topic, we will study what a `complex state` is, how to handle it, and the techniques for splitting state in functional components. Let's embark on this exciting journey!

## Understanding Complex State in React
Complex state in **React** is akin to a box brimming with diverse items — numbers, strings, array, or other objects. The occurrence of a complex state is common in large-scale apps.

Consider a shopping cart in a web application:

```javaScript
const [shoppingCart, setShoppingCart] = useState([
  { name: "Apple", quantity: 3, price: 0.5 },
  { name: "Orange", quantity: 2, price: 0.75 },
  // Additional items...
]);
```
Here, our `shoppingCart` state, an array of objects, represents a typical instance of complex state in React.

## Managing Complex State in Functional Components
React provides us with a potent tool, the `useState()` hook, for effectively managing complex states. For instance, to add an item to our cart, we use the `setShoppingCart()` function with the JavaScript spread operator `...`:

```javaScript
// Adding a new item to our shopping cart
setShoppingCart([...shoppingCart, { name: "Banana", quantity: 1, price: 1 }]);
```
This snippet creates a copy of our current state, adds a new item to it, and updates the state with this new object, demonstrating React's principle of immutability!

## Understanding When and How To Split State in Functional Components
Sometimes, a complex state feels like a tangled knot, intimidating and overwhelming. In such situations, 'splitting' the state into smaller, manageable units might be beneficial. Such splitting results in more 'useState' calls but promotes independent states, facilitating state management.

In our shopping cart, we could create independent state variables for each item attribute:

```javaScript
const [itemName, setItemName] = useState('Apple');
const [itemQuantity, setItemQuantity] = useState(3);
const [itemPrice, setItemPrice] = useState(0.5);
```
In this way, each attribute of the shopping cart item retains its separate state.

## Practical Application of Splitting State in Functional Components
Let's put state splitting into practice! Visualize a form that adds items to our shopping cart. We can construct separate states for each form field:

```javaScript
const [itemName, setItemName] = useState("");
const [itemQuantity, setItemQuantity] = useState(1);
const [itemPrice, setItemPrice] = useState(1);
```
Next, upon form submission, add a new item to our cart:

```javaScript
function addItem(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  setShoppingCart([...shoppingCart, { name: itemName, quantity: itemQuantity, price: itemPrice }]);
  setItemName("");
  setItemQuantity(1);
  setItemPrice(1);
}
```
This `addItem` function prevents the form's default refresh behavior, adds a new item to our cart, and then resets the form fields to their initial states. This demonstrates the practical application of splitting a state in a React functional component.

## Capturing Form Data in React
Let's take a moment to discuss an additional skill related to managing state in React: capturing form data. Specifically, we'll cover how to handle user input in a form and how to update our component state accordingly.

In a React form, each input element can be controlled by the state of a component. This makes keeping track of user input straightforward. Every time the user inputs data, an event handler updates the state with the new value. For this, we need a piece of state for each input, along with a function to update this state.

```javaScript
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");
```
Here, `firstName` and `lastName` state variables represent the input fields of our form.

Next, we need a function to handle the changes in these input fields.

```javaScript
function handleFirstNameChange(event) {
  setFirstName(event.target.value);
}

function handleLastNameChange(event) {
  setLastName(event.target.value);
}
```
In the `handleFirstNameChange` and `handleLastNameChange` functions, we update the state variables `firstName` and `lastName` with the new value the user has typed into the input fields.

Now, let's integrate these into a form:

```javaScript
<form>
  <label>
    First Name:
    <input type="text" value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
  </label>
  <label>
    Last Name:
    <input type="text" value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
  </label>
</form>
```
In this form, `value` attributes of the input tags set the current state variables `firstName` and `lastName`. When the user types something, the `onChange` event triggers, calling our `handleFirstNameChange` and `handleLastNameChange` functions. These functions then update the state to match what the user has typed into the input boxes.

This is a basic pattern for handling form data in React. As you work with more complex forms and states, bear in mind everything we've covered so far. Feel free to combine these ideas to suit your unique form needs! Good luck!
