# Fuel Management: Code Construction

Prepare your spaceship's fuel management system! Your mission is to create a component that tracks fuel levels and displays the remaining fuel. The fuel gauge should warn you if the fuel is depleted. Implement a button functionality that allows the astronaut to **decrease the fuel level** but never below zero. Focus on using the state management techniques you have learned.
