# Spaceship Velocity Adjustment Challenge

Stellar Navigator, we have encountered an issue with our `SpaceshipControl` code! The speed doesn't react as we'd expect when we try to increase it. Can you identify and correct the problem? Pay close attention to how the `previous state` is used. Engage your troubleshooting skills!
