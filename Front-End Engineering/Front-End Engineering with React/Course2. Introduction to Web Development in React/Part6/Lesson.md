# Exploring the Cosmos: Props, Previous State, and Conditional State Updates in React

## Topic Overview and Plan
Welcome! Today, we'll journey deeper into React, focusing on `props`, state updates, and conditional state updates. Our itinerary includes:

A review of `props`.
An explanation of the previous state.
The handling of state updates based on the previous state.
Conditional state updates based on the previous state.

## Review of `props` in Functional Components
In our React journey, `props` act as a suitcase, carrying items from parent to child components. However, `props` are read-onlyâ€”the data passed from the parent to the child should not be changed by the child.

```javaScript
// Child Component
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
}

// Parent Component
function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent message="Hello there!" />
}

ParentComponent(); // Renders: Hello there!
```
In this example, `ParentComponent` sends a message via `props` to `ChildComponent`, which then displays it.

## Previous State: The Key to Dynamic State Management
In React, the previous state helps us understand changes in state over time. When managing React state, the concept of the previous state becomes crucial due to the asynchronous nature of `setState` events.

Consider this `Counter` component:

```javaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Here, count is the previous state
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p> {/* Displays the count */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button> {/* Increments the counter when clicked */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
This `Counter` uses the previous `count` to calculate the new `count`.

## State Update based on Previous State
Imagine you're navigating through a labyrinth. At times, your next move depends not just on your present location but also on how you got there â€” your previous state.

In React, too, your component's next state often depends on the previous one. Why? Because `setState` updates might be asynchronous. This means that JavaScript doesn't immediately update the current state and re-render the component when `setState` is called. Instead, it schedules these operations for future execution and proceeds to the next line of code. This future execution can lead to errors when a subsequent state update depends on the change just scheduled. Itâ€™s like planning to take a right turn based on a preceding left turn, but the left hasn't been taken yet.

That's when we base the state update on the previous state. By passing a function to `setState`, we ensure accurate updates even with asynchronous modifications. This function receives the previous state value, performs the necessary state update operations, and returns the new state value.

To optimize our `Counter` component, consider this variant of `handleClick`:

```javaScript
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
};
```
In `handleClick`, we pass a function to `setCount`. This function takes `prevCount` (the previous count) as an argument and returns `prevCount + 1`, ensuring count incrementation based on the correct previous count. So, no matter when JavaScript executes this state update, it derives the new count accurately from the confirmed previous count.

## State Update: Asynchronous Nature
State updates in React can indeed be asynchronous, which means they are not instantaneous and can be batched together for performance gains. The asynchronous nature of `setState` becomes particularly noticeable when state updates are dependent on each other.

Consider this simple counter:

```javaScript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementTwice = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={incrementTwice}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Here, when you press the button, you might expect the counter to increment by `2`. But due to the asynchronous nature of `setState`, both `setCount` calls see the same value of count. Consequently, they both increment the same initial value by `1`, resulting in a total increment of `1`, not `2`.

To ensure each update has the correct previous value, we pass a function to `setState`, like so:

```javaScript
const incrementTwice = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
};
```
Now each `setCount` call receives and operates on the most recent count, resulting in a total increment of `2`. Thus, to get reliable state updates, always use the function form of `setState` when the update depends on the previous state.

## Conditional State Update based on Previous State
Our journey in React may depend on our previous steps. As such, we may require conditional state updates based on the previous state. Consider a counter that cannot exceed a certain limit:

```javaScript
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => {
    // Only increment count if prevCount is less than 10.
    // Otherwise, leave it as it is.
    return prevCount >= 10 ? prevCount : prevCount + 1;
  });
};
```
This example will increment `count` only if `prevCount` is less than `10`.

## Complex Conditional State Updates based on Previous State
There are instances when our decisions aren't straightforward and depend on multiple factors from the past. This situation corresponds to complex conditional state updates in React.

Consider this scenario â€” you're traversing different planets (states), and on each planet, you have different rules to follow for your next journey. Your decision for your next location is based not just on your previous state (planet), but also additional conditions like the resources available or the distance to the next planet.

In the React universe, we can implement the desired features using complex conditional state updates. Here's a more nuanced example. Suppose we have a counter that can't exceed a certain limit but also should not fall below zero.

```javaScript
const handleClick = (operation) => {
  setCount(prevCount => {
    // If the operation is increment and prevCount is less than 10, increment count.
    // If the operation is decrement and prevCount is greater than 0, decrement count.
    // Otherwise, return count as it is.
    if (operation === 'increment' && prevCount < 10) return prevCount + 1;
    if (operation === 'decrement' && prevCount > 0) return prevCount - 1;
    return prevCount;
  });
};
```
In this code, `handleClick` accepts an operation (either `'increment'` or `'decrement'`). If we're incrementing and the `prevCount` is less than `10`, or if we're decrementing and the `prevCount` is more than `0`, we adjust the `count` accordingly. Otherwise, we return `count` as is. This complex conditional state update allows us to precisely control state transitions based on multiple factors from the previous state.

By understanding and utilizing complex conditional state updates based on the previous state in React, you're giving your functional components a greater degree of flexibility and robustness needed to handle real-world scenarios. With these new skills, you're ready to make your journey through the React cosmos even more fascinating and efficient! ðŸš€

## Lesson Summary and Practice Announcement
