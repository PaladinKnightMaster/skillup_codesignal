# Managing Spaceship Fuel Levels in React

Prepare for liftoff, Space Wanderer! Your mission is to manage the spaceship's **fuel level**. Create a **React component** that displays and controls the fuel level. Your control panel should show the current fuel level and decrease it by **10** when the 'Use Fuel' button is pressed. Remember, a spaceship must maintain its operations to explore the cosmos!
