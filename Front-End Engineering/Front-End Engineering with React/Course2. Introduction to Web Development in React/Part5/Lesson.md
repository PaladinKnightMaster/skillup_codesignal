# Navigating the Cosmos of React State Management: A Journey into useState and setState with Hardcoded Data

## Lesson Introduction & Goal Setting
Hello, dear learner! Are you ready to delve into the world of React? Today, we'll explore the React state — data that a component manages and modifies. Think of a traffic light: its color (red, yellow, or green) is the state of the traffic light.

Our chief aim is to learn how to utilize `useState` and `setState` to manage the state in React components using hardcoded data. Excited? Let's begin!

## Understanding What State Is in React
In React, "state" refers to the data of a component that can be monitored and altered. Picture a simple counter: the `count` value is our state data. When someone clicks the increment button, the `count` changes, which triggers a re-render.

```javaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter()  {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Declare 'count' state variable with initial value 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p> {/* Display the current count */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button> // Increment count when button is clicked
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
In this code snippet, our state variable `count` is declared and initialized with `0` using `useState(0)`. When the button is clicked, the `count` increases, initiating a re-render of the component.

## Introducing `useState`
`useState` is a React hook that introduces state to functional components. `useState` is used to declare a state variable. It returns a pair: the current state value and a function to update it.

```javaScript
const [myState, setMyState] = useState(initialState);
```
Let's declare a state variable `color` with an initial state:
```javaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ColorChanger() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red"); // Declare 'color' state variable with initial value 'red'

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>The current color is {color}</h1> {/* Output the color */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ColorChanger;
```

## Using `useState` with Hardcoded Data
Suppose we have a `favoriteColor` component that uses `useState` to manage hardcoded data:

```javaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [favoriteColor, setFavoriteColor] = useState("blue"); // Define 'favoriteColor' with initial (hardcoded) value 'blue'

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My favorite color is {favoriteColor}</h1> {/* Output the favorite color */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default FavoriteColor;
```
`FavoriteColor` always displays "My favorite color is blue" — because `favoriteColor` is hardcoded as `"blue"`.

## Introducing `setState`
Do you want to shuffle colors? You can! `setState` is used to update state variables.

By using `setState`, we ask React to reassign our state variable and re-render our component.

## Using `setState` with Hardcoded Data
Let's illustrate the updating of state with hardcoded data:

```javaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [favoriteColor, setFavoriteColor] = useState("blue");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My favorite color is {favoriteColor}</h1> {/* Output the favorite color */}
      <button onClick={() => setFavoriteColor("green")}> {/* Change color on button click */}
        Change Favorite Color
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FavoriteColor;
```
In `FavoriteColor`, we've added a button. When it's clicked, `setFavoriteColor("green")` is called, changing the `favoriteColor` state to `"green"` and causing a re-render of the component.

## Lesson Summary and Practice Announcement
Excellent job! You have managed to grasp the concepts of state, `useState`, and `setState` in React. These give you the ability to create components that are aware of their purpose.

You have learned:

- What "state" means in React.
- How to declare a state variable using `useState`.
- How to use `useState` and `setState` to alter the state of a component.
Next, practicing these concepts will help to cement them. The more you practice, the better you'll become. Remember, becoming a skilled React developer requires practicing regularly. Let's continue on our learning journey!
