# Spacecraft Component Launch

Imagine our React app as a spacecraft, where each component is a different part of the ship. The given code creates a new component called `Spacecraft`, which displays a welcome message to would-be spacefarers. Run the code to see how `Spacecraft` becomes a part of our React Galaxy!
