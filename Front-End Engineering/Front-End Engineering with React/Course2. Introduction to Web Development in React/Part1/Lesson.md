# Introduction to React: Library or Framework?
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. As opposed to a framework, React gives you the flexibility to use only the parts you need, thereby making it a "library". If you were to imagine your React application as a house, the components would be its building blocks.

# Creating a Simple Functional Component
Think of a React component as a piece of Lego that is reusable and can be used to build different shapes. Hereâ€™s how to create a functional component:

```javaScript
function WelcomeMessage() {
  return (
    <div>
      Welcome to React!
    </div>
  );
}

export default WelcomeMessage;
```
We've composed a basic React functional component that returns JSX. It's like a Lego block that says, "Welcome to React!".

# Anatomy of a Minimal Functional Component
The `WelcomeMessage` function is a popular type of React component, known as a functional component. The `return` statement outputs JSX, while `export default WelcomeMessage;` allows us to use our component elsewhere, akin to attaching it to a larger Lego structure.

# Introduction to JSX
JSX allows us to write HTML-like syntax within our JavaScript code, bridging the gap between HTML and JavaScript.

```javaScript
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
Although it looks like HTML, it's actually JavaScript with a special syntax.

# React's Virtual DOM
Consider the Virtual DOM as an artist sketching their design before painting it on the canvas. React's Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM where React first applies changes. It then uses this to calculate the most efficient way to implement the same changes to the real DOM.

# Basic React Project Structure
When you start a new React project using "Create React App" (CRA), it generates a simple project structure. Here's how the basic structure of a React project would look:

```markdown
my-app
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.css
    â””â”€â”€ index.css
```
In this structure:

* `README.md` is the documentation file.
* `node_modules` is the directory where all the modules from `npm` (node package manager) installer are stored.
* `package.json` is the file that contains various metadata relevant to the project, including dependencies.
* `public` directory contains static resources. Among them are:
    * `index.html` which is the HTML file that is served when users visit your site.
    * `favicon.ico` which is the icon that appears on the tab where your website is opened in a web browser.
* `src` directory contains all JavaScript, CSS and tests related to the application. Among them are:
* `App.js` which is the main functional component in the application.
* `index.js` is the JavaScript file that sets up the ReactDOM and is a main entry point to the app.
* `App.css` and `index.css` are stylesheets for the App and overall application respectively.

# Rendering React Components
Rendering is the process of putting React elements into the DOM. In a typical React app, we'd write and export components in separate files, then import and use them wherever necessary.

We've created a functional component called `WelcomeMessage` in the previous sections. Let's continue with that:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function WelcomeMessage() {
  return <div>Welcome to React!</div>;
}

export default WelcomeMessage;
```
This `WelcomeMessage` component can be thought of as a JavaScript function that returns a JSX element. To use this component and render its output (the JSX element) in the HTML document, we import it to the `index.js` file.

In your `index.js` file, you would import the `WelcomeMessage` component that we defined earlier and use ReactDOM's render method to render it into the DOM like this:

```javaScript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import WelcomeMessage from './WelcomeMessage'; // assuming the WelcomeMessage is in the same folder

ReactDOM.render(
  <WelcomeMessage />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
This specific way of rendering React Components is quite meaningful:
* `ReactDOM.render()` is a method from the ReactDOM object that takes two arguments.
* The first argument, `<WelcomeMessage />`, is our imported `WelcomeMessage` component.
* The second argument, `document.getElementById('root')`, is the location in the real DOM where we want our component to be rendered.
In simple terms, this code is taking our `<WelcomeMessage />` component and rendering it into a div with an id of root in the actual DOM. The div with id root is typically defined inside `public/index.html` file in the generated project structure (from React CRA). This div serves as the root (hence the name) or the entry point for our React application.

# Commenting in React
Comments in your code are vital. They help other developers (and you as well in the future) understand what's happening in the code. Commenting in React is a bit different due to JSX, but it's still pretty straightforward.

In JavaScript, we typically use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. In JSX, since it's similar to HTML, we wrap our comments inside curly braces `{}` and then follow the JavaScript commenting style.

# Single Line Comments
To leave a single line comment in JSX, wrap the comment inside `{}`:

```javaScript
// This is a single line comment in JavaScript
<div>
  Welcome to React! {/* This is a single line comment in JSX */}
</div>
```

# Multi-line Comments
Similarly, for multi-line comments in JSX, we wrap the comment inside `{}`:

```javaScript
/*
This is a multi-line comment
in JavaScript
*/

<div>
  {
    /*
    This is a multi-line comment
    in JSX
    */
  }
  Welcome to React!
</div>
```
Remember, while commenting might seem insignificant now, it's a vital habit to form as your applications grow in complexity and are viewed by others. So make good use of comments in your code to ensure it's understandable to the wide range of developers who may interact with it. Happy coding! ðŸš€
