# Navigating to a New Dimension

Stellar work, Galactic Pioneer! Are you ready for a small tweak in our navigation system? Please change the `SpacecraftDetails` component to display both the spacecraft name and its **mission code**. The URL should look like this: `/spacecraft/apollo11/mission1`. Add the mission code to both the dynamic route and the component.
