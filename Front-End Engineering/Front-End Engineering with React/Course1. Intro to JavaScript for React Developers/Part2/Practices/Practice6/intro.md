# Asteroid Detection Logic Creation

Great work with the detectors, Space Voyager! It's now time for you to craft your own object detection code from scratch. Your objective is to determine whether a detected object in space is an asteroid based on its properties. Display an appropriate message reflecting the detection on the spacecraft's UI.

To observe the behavior of your code, run and preview it in the UI. Additionally, be sure to examine the `solution.js` file, where you'll articulate your detection logic.
