# Satellite Status Tracker Debugging

Space Voyager, we've encountered a small anomaly in the satellite tracker system. The messages indicating the activity status of the satellites aren't displaying as intended. Your mission is to investigate the system's `solution.js` and implement the necessary fixes to ensure that we see the status `'active'` if the satellite `isActive` field is true. Are you ready to **debug**?
