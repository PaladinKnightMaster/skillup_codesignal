# Expanding the Fleet: Write the Code

Space Explorer, the fleet needs an update! Begin by creating an **HTML** page with a script that expands our `vehicle` array. Add a new `'Spaceship'` to the array using `ES6` features, and display the updated vehicle fleet on the page. Please run and preview your code in the UI preview, and be sure to check out the `solution.js` file.
