# Spacecraft Speed Anomaly

Space Voyager, it seems there's a hiccup in the Spacecraft Speed Display. The speeds should be extracted from the array and shown on the screen, but alas, they're not displaying correctly. Can you identify and rectify the issue lurking in the code? Best of luck on your debugging mission!
