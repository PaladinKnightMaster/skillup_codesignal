# Debug the Doggy Daycare Display

Stellar Navigator, our doggy daycare app, is experiencing a hiccup and isn't displaying the dogs' name. Could you debug the code to ensure each dog's details are visible? Pay close attention to the **JavaScript class setup** and the **DOM manipulation**. To see your changes, run and preview the code in the UI preview. Please check the `solution.js` file.
