# Add Playtime Update to Doggy Daycare Class

Stellar Navigator, let's enhance our **Dog** class! In the `addPlaytime` method within the `Dog` class in `solution.js`, we seem to have omitted the code necessary for increasing playtime. Could you insert the code that increments the `playMinutes` property by the amount of time provided to the method, ensuring the resulting value remains positive? To evaluate your modifications, please run and preview the code through the UI preview, and remember to examine the `solution.js` file.
