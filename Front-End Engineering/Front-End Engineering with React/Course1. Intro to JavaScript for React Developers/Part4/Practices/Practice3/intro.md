# Cosmic Orbit Malfunction

Stellar Navigator, your mission is to ensure that our orbit tracking system is error-free. The webpage is **supposed to periodically update the number of orbits** completed by a planet. However, there appears to be a slight malfunction. Can you identify and correct it to restore proper tracking?

Please **run and preview the code** in the UI preview, and remember to review the `solution.js` file to diagnose and resolve the issue with the orbit tracking system.
