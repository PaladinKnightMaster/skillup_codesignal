# Cosmic Code: Rendering Country Stats in React

Great work, Space Voyager! Now it's time to craft an entire React component that fetches country stats and displays them. Remember to handle the fetch process, set the initial state, and render the data. Be sure to utilize the API endpoint `https://api-regional.codesignalcontent.com/countryStats/search?name=${countryName}`. Ready for lift-off?
