# Digital Postman: Update Loading Message

Great job so far, Stellar Navigator!

Let's enhance our digital postal service by changing the initial message from `'Preparing to send...'` to `'Loading digital mail...'` to better relate to our scenario. Also, update the success message to `'Digital mail received successfully!'`.

Keep up the good work!
