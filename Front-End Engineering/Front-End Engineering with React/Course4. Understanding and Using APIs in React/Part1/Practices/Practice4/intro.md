# Fetching Cosmic Weather Data

Superb exploration, Stellar Navigator! Let us now steer our ship toward fetching the current weather data. Your mission is to command our fetch probe to retrieve the data from the **cosmic API** and call upon the **React state** to record our findings. Remember, we are securing our data right now, so focus on the fetch call and processing the **JSON** response.
