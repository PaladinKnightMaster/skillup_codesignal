# Debug the Titanic Dataset Loading Code

Brilliant work so far, Space Voyager! We have a dataset ready for inspection, but it seems our script is tripping over its own feet. Can you identify the hiccup and get the dataset exploration back on track?

The code should output the first few records, the dataset's info, and its general statistics. Look closelyâ€”the devil is in the details!
