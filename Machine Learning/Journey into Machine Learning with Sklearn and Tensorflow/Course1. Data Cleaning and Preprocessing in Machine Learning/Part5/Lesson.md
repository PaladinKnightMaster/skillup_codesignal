# Data Preprocessing: Mastering Normalization and Standardization Techniques

## Lesson Introduction
Welcome to our enlightening session on Normalization and Standardization of Passenger Data. These two techniques play a crucial role in preparing your data for machine learning algorithms. During this lesson, our focus will particularly be on the historical Titanic dataset, where we will practice cleaning, normalizing, and standardizing certain features, such as passenger ages and fares. By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of normalization and standardization and be able to apply these techniques in any data preprocessing assignment using Python and Pandas.

## Understanding Normalization
Normalization is a critical preprocessing step, which primarily involves scaling the numerical data in the dataset to a fixed range, usually from 0 to 1. It reduces skewness and bias in the data by bringing all the values to a similar range. Therefore, normalization plays a significant role in algorithms that use a distance measure.

To better illustrate how normalization works, let's apply it to the `'age'` column of our Titanic dataset. Normalization will transform the age values so that they fall within a range from 0 to 1:

```Python
# Import necessary libraries
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic Dataset
titanic_df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Normalize 'age'
titanic_df['age'] = (titanic_df['age'] - titanic_df['age'].min()) / (titanic_df['age'].max() - titanic_df['age'].min())

# Display the normalized ages
print(titanic_df['age'])
```

Output:

```Markdown
0      0.271174
1      0.472229
2      0.321438
3      0.434531
4      0.434531
         ...
886    0.334004
887    0.233476
888         NaN
889    0.321438
890    0.396833
Name: age, Length: 891, dtype: float64
```

In this code snippet, we first subtract the minimum age from each age value, then divide by the range of ages. The ages are scaled to the range `[0, 1]`. Normalized columns are easier for some machine-learning models to process.

## Understanding Standardization
Unlike normalization, standardization does not scale the data to a limited range. Instead, standardization subtracts the mean value of the feature and then divides it by the featureâ€™s standard deviation, transforming the feature values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This method is often used when you want to compare data that was measured on different scales.

Let's apply standardization to the `'fare'` column of the Titanic dataset. This column represents how much each passenger paid for their ticket:

```Python
# Standardize 'fare'
titanic_df['fare'] = (titanic_df['fare'] - titanic_df['fare'].mean()) / titanic_df['fare'].std()

# Display the standardized fares
print(titanic_df['fare'])
```

Output:

```Markdown
0     -0.502163
1      0.786404
2     -0.488580
3      0.420494
4     -0.486064
         ...
886   -0.386454
887   -0.044356
888   -0.176164
889   -0.044356
890   -0.492101
Name: fare, Length: 891, dtype: float64
```

Now, the `'fare'` column is re-scaled so the fares have an average value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Notice that the values are not within the `[0, 1]` range like normalized data.

## Implementing Normalization with Pandas
Armed with an understanding of normalization, let's dig a little deeper with the Pandas library. We'll use `MinMaxScaler()` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module, a handy technique for normalizing data in pandas:

```Python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Select 'age' column and drop NaN values
age = titanic_df[['age']].dropna()

# Create a MinMaxScaler object
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Use the scaler
titanic_df['norm_age'] = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(age), columns=age.columns, index=age.index)

# Display normalized age values
print(titanic_df['norm_age'])
```

Output:

```Markdown
0      0.271174
1      0.472229
2      0.321438
3      0.434531
4      0.434531
         ...
886    0.334004
887    0.233476
888         NaN
889    0.321438
890    0.396833
Name: norm_age, Length: 891, dtype: float64
```

The MinMaxScaler scales and translates each feature individually so that it falls in the given range on the training set, in our case, between `0` and `1`.

## Implementing Standardization with Pandas
To standardize our data with pandas, we'll make use of the `StandardScaler()` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module that standardizes features by deducting the mean and scaling to unit variance:

```Python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Select 'fare' column and drop NaN values
fare = titanic_df[['fare']].dropna()

# Create a StandardScaler object
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Use the scaler
titanic_df['stand_fare'] = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(fare), columns=fare.columns, index=fare.index)

# Display standardized fare values
print(titanic_df['stand_fare'])
```

Output:

```Markdown
0     -0.502445
1      0.786845
2     -0.488854
3      0.420730
4     -0.486337
         ...
886   -0.386671
887   -0.044381
888   -0.176263
889   -0.044381
890   -0.492378
Name: stand_fare, Length: 891, dtype: float64
```

`StandardScaler` standardizes a feature by deducting the mean and scaling to unit variance. This operation is performed feature-wise in an independent way. Notice how our standardized fares now have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Comparing Normalization and Standardization
Choose normalization when your data needs to be bounded within a specific range (0 to 1, for example) and is not heavily influenced by outliers. This is particularly useful for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. On the other hand, standardization is more effective when your data has a Gaussian distribution, and you are dealing with algorithms that assume this, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis.

Now that you've got to experience both normalization and standardization, it's safe to say each technique is practical and useful but under different circumstances. Their primary purpose is to handle the varying ranges of data. However, depending on the algorithm deployed and the desired output distribution, normalization or standardization is selected. Remember that not all algorithms benefit from normalization or standardization.
