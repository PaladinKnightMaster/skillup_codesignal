# Debugging the Feature Engineering Pipeline

Outstanding progress, Space Voyager! A piece of the puzzle seems to be slightly amiss within our processing of the Abalone dataset. Your mission: scour the feature engineering code and identify the error. Ensure the PCA reduction is utilizing the freshly encoded features for its calculations. Trust your instincts and debugging skills to set this right.
