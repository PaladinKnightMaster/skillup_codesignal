# Implementing Logistic Regression Model with Iris Dataset

Stellar Navigator, it's time to dive deeper. Your mission is to implement the code that trains the Logistic Regression model on our Iris dataset. Try setting low `max_iter` values following this syntax `LogisticRegression(max_iter = 5)` to observe when the regression starts to converge.
