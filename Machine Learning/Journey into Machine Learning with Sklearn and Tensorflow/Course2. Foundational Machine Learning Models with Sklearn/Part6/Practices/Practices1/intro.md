# Implement Linear Regression on the Iris Dataset

Now, let's explore how different features influence our Linear Regression model. Modify the starter code to use `petal_width` instead of `petal_length`. Observe the coefficient change after fitting the model. This exercise will help you understand the impact of different features.
