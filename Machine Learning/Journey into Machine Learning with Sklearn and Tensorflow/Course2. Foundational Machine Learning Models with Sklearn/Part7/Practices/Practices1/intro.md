# Adjust Hyperparameters and Optimize the Same Model

Now, adjust the starter code's hyperparameter range for `max_depth` in `GridSearchCV`. Include a couple more depth options based on your understanding from the lesson to explore how varying the depth affects the model's performance. Remember, the best hyperparameters help tune the model to achieve better accuracy.
