# Adjust Hyperparameters and Optimize with RandomSearchCV

Stellar job on optimizing our classifier! Let's step it up a notch. Your next mission is to program the hyperparameter space for our tree-based model. Define the range for the 'max_depth' and other hyperparameters for our `RandomizedSearch`. May your code be as sharp as the edge of the Milky Way!
