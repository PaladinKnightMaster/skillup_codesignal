# Regression and Gradient Descent

Dig deep into regression and learn about the gradient descent algorithm. This course does not rely on high-level libraries like scikit-learn, but focuses on building these algorithms from scratch for a thorough understanding. Master the implementation of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression powered by gradient descent.
