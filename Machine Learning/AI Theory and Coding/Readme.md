# AI Theory and Coding

Dive deep into the intricate universe of Artificial Intelligence with this in-depth learning path. This path is perfectly suited for those who wish to not only understand the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning algorithms but also wish to learn how to code these algorithms from scratch, without relying on common libraries such as Sklearn. You'll start with grasping the essence of Machine Learning, dissect the underlying principles, and then move on to implementing some of the most fundamental and crucial algorithms in ML all by yourself.

This learning path includes:

- 6 courses with bite-sized lessons and practices
- 26 engaging lessons in text and video formats
- 107 hands-on practices in our state-of-the art IDE
- One-on-one guidance from Cosmo, our AI tutor
