# Learning Rate Scheduler Configuration

Now that you've learned about learning rate schedulers, let's practice by completing this missing part of the code that sets the base for our scheduler to work. Remember what the learning rate is part of, because that's the piece our scheduler needs to track the learning rate.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
