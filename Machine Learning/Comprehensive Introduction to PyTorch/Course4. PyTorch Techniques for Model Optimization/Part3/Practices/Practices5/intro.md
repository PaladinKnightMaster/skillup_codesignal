# Learning Rate Scheduler Implementation

Excellent progress on learning about learning rate scheduling in `PyTorch`! Now it's time to put your skills to the ultimate test. Your task is to complete the provided Python script which accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Define the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler using mode as `min`, factor of `0.1`, and patience of `10` epochs.
2. Implement the logic to calculate the validation loss during training.
3. Update the learning rate based on validation loss using the scheduler.
4. Print the learning rate every 10 epochs.

Ensure you follow the steps carefully and fill in the TODOs in the provided script.
