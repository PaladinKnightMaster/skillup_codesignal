# Updating Learning Rate in PyTorch

Excellent progress on learning how to use the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler in PyTorch! In this exercise, you'll practice setting up a simple model and filling in the missing code for the training loop to ensure it updates the learning rate based on the validation loss.

You'll need to complete the training loop and make sure the `scheduler` properly updates the learning rate.
