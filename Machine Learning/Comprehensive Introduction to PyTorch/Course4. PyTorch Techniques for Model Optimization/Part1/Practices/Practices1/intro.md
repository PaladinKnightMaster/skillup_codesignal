# Comparing Validation Loss for Checkpointing

You've made great progress in learning how to save models based on validation loss.

For this exercise, implement the condition for checkpointing based on the validation loss. Complete the code below to save the model whenever the validation loss decreases.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
