# Completing Model Checkpointing in PyTorch

In the previous lesson, you learned about the importance of model checkpointing and how to implement it based on validation loss. Now let's practice filling in some missing parts of the code to save the model whenever the validation loss improves.

This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of the checkpointing technique and ensure you can correctly implement it.
