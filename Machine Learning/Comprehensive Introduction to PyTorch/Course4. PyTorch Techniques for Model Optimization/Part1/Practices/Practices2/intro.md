# Model Checkpointing Using Training Loss

Excellent progress! You have learned about model checkpointing and its significance in training neural networks. In the provided code, the model is saved based on the validation loss. However, we want to change it to save based on the training loss. Your task is to modify the code to ensure that the model is saved if the training loss decreases.
