# Model Checkpointing in PyTorch

Great job on learning the basics of model checkpointing in PyTorch!

Now, let's put your skills to the test by writing a complete Python script to implement model checkpointing based on the validation loss. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of the checkpointing technique and ensure you can correctly implement it in real-world scenarios.
