# Fix Dropout Layer in PyTorch

Great job on learning how to prevent overfitting! Now, let's dive deeper into identifying and fixing errors in our code.

In our current neural network model, we aimed to use dropout layers to randomly deactivate neurons during training. However, there's a bug that is preventing the model from learning at all. Your task is to identify and resolve the issue with the dropout layers in the provided neural network model.
