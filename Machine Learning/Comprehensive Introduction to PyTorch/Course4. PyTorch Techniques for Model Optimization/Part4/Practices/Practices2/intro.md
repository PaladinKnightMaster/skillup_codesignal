# Adjust Weight Decay in Training

You've been doing great so far! Now, let's refine the regularization technique applied during training.

In the current model, weight decay (`L2 regularization`) is introduced at epoch 50 with a value of `0.01`. Modify the code to set this weight decay value to `0.005` instead.

This tweak will affect how the model's weights are controlled during training.
