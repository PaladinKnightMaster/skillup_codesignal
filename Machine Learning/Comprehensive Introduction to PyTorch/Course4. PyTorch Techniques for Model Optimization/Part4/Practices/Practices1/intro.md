# Adding Dropout to PyTorch Model

In this task, you will practice implementing dropout in a given neural network model using `PyTorch`. Dropout layers are a useful way to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units (along with their connections) during training. You need to complete the missing parts of the code to add `dropout` layers to the model.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
