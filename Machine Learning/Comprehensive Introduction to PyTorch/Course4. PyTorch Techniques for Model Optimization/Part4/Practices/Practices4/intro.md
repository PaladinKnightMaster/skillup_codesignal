# Add Dropout and Regularization Layers

You've made excellent progress so far! In this task, you will practice completing a PyTorch neural network model with dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Add `dropout` layers to the model.
2. Define the `optimizer` and `criterion` for training.
3. Add a condition to adjust the `optimizer` to include `L2` regularization from a certain epoch.

Complete the missing sections to finish the model.
