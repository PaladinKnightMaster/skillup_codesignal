# Fix the Mini-Batch Training Bug

So far, you have learned how to train a model using mini-batches in `PyTorch`. Now, let's practice identifying and fixing a bug.

You're given a model training code snippet that uses a `DataLoader` to handle mini-batches. However, there is a bug in how we iterate through the `data_loader`. Your task is to identify and fix the bug to ensure the model trains correctly.
