# Using Mini-Batches with the Wine Dataset in PyTorch

Great job learning how to create mini-batches using `DataLoader` in PyTorch! Now, let's practice filling in the missing part of the code.

Your task is to complete the line of code that initializes the `DataLoader` to handle the Wine dataset in mini-batches of size 32 and shuffle the data.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
