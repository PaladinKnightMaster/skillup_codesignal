# Change the Mini-Batch Size

Great job so far! Let's advance to something slightly more challenging.

We'll modify our existing PyTorch training code's `DataLoader` to use a different batch size. This exercise will help you understand how changing the mini-batch size affects the training efficiency and memory usage.

Change the batch size from `32` to `16` and observe how it impacts the training process.
