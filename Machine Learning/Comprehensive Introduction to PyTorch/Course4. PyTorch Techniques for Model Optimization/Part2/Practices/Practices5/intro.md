# Train a PyTorch Model using Mini-Batches

In the previous tasks, you learned how to create mini-batches and use them to train a model. Now, let's put it all together in a complete implementation.

Write the entire `PyTorch` training process using mini-batches for the Wine dataset from scratch. Follow the instructions provided in the `TODO` comments to guide you through the implementation.
