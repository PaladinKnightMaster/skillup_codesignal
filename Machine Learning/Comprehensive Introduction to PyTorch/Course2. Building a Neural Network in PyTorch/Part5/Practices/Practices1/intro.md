# Running Model Evaluation in PyTorch

Well done on learning how to evaluate a model in PyTorch!

Now, let's practice running a simple program to review what you've learned. In this task, you'll be working with a neural network model in PyTorch that predicts the outcome of soccer matches. The provided Python code trains a model based on features representing average goals scored by our team and average goals conceded by the opponent, evaluates its performance on test data, and reports the accuracy and loss.

Your task is to simply run the provided Python code to see the results of model evaluation in action. This hands-on practice will help reinforce your understanding of model evaluation in PyTorch.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
