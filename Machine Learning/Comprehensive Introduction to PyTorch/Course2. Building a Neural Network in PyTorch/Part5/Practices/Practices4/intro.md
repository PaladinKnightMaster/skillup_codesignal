# Evaluating PyTorch Model Performance

Fantastic! You have now learned how to evaluate a model in PyTorch using accuracy as an evaluation metric. Let's move on to the next practice exercise.

In this task, you need to complete the missing code to calculate the `test accuracy` and `test loss` of the model.
