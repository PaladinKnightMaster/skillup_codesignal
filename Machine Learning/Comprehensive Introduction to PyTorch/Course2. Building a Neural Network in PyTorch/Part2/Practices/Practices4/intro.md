# Building a Three-Layer Sequential Model

Congrats on running a Sequential Model in PyTorch! Now, let's solidify your understanding of this topic further. For this task, you are required to write a PyTorch `Sequential` model with three layers:

1. First layer: input size 3, output size 7, followed by ReLU.
2. Second layer: input size 7, output size 5, followed by ReLU.
3. Third layer: input size 5, output size 1, followed by Sigmoid.

After constructing the model, print its architecture.
