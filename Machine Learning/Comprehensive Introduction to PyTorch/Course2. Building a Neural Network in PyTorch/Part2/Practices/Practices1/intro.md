# Running a Sequential Model in PyTorch

Congratulations on finishing the lesson! Now, before we move on to the next concept, let's practice running a basic neural network model in PyTorch. You need to run the provided Python module that creates a `Sequential` model and displays it.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
