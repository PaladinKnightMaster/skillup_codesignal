# Building a 2-Layer Neural Network

Great work so far! Now that we've covered how to initialize a neural network model in `PyTorch`, let's put it all together and build your own neural network from scratch.

You've been given the task of writing a Python program using `PyTorch` to create a `3-layer` Fully Connected Neural Network from scratch. The Neural Network should have the following structure:

* **Layer 1**: A Fully Connected Layer with an input size of `10` and an output size of `20`, followed by a `ReLU` activation function.
* **Layer 2**: Another Fully Connected Layer with an input size of `20` and an output size of `15`, followed by another `ReLU` activation function.
* **Layer 3**: A Fully Connected Layer with an input size of `15` and an output size of `5`, followed by a `Sigmoid` activation function.

After you've defined the class, instantiate it, and print out the architecture of the Neural Network.
