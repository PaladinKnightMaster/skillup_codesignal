# Changing Network's Input and Output Sizes

Let's move on to initializing a neural network with a different number of inputs and outputs. In this task, change the network's initial input size to `4` and the final output size to `2`. After making this change, instantiate the class and print the architecture of the new neural network.

Check how these changes affect the output of the model summary!
