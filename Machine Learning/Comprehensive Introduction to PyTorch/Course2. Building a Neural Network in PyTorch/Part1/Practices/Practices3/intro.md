# Correcting PyTorch Neural Network Definition

Well done on initializing a neural network model! However, there appears to be an error in the provided code. The code aims to create another fully connected layer, `layer3`. This layer should take an input from `layer2` and produce a final output for the Sigmoid function. But an error prevents the correct flow of the tensors.

Your task is to identify the error and correct it.
