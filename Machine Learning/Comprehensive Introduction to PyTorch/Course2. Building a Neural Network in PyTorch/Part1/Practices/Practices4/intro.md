# Initialize and Instantiate a PyTorch Model

Great job on learning how to initialize a Basic Neural Network in PyTorch! Now, let's practice filling in some missing code.

Your task is to finish the missing initialization function with the layers and the activation functions of this Neural Network. After you have completed your `SimpleNN` class definition, instantiate this class as `model`.
