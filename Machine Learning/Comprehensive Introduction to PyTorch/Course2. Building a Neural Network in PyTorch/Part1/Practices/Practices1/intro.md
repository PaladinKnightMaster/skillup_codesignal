# Running a Simple Neural Network in PyTorch

In this task, you will practice running a simple program to create and print a PyTorch model. We have constructed a basic neural network model named `SimpleNN`. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with a ReLU activation function, and an output layer with a Sigmoid activation function.

Your task is to run the provided code that demonstrates how to instantiate the `SimpleNN` class and print the architecture of the neural network.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
