# Modifying Probability Threshold for Prediction

Now that you've learned how to make predictions using a trained PyTorch model, let's practice changing the probability threshold for making a prediction.

Your task is to change the probability threshold to `0.3` and then run the code to see the output. By lowering the threshold, we are deciding that the team doesn't need a very high chance (just 30%) to be predicted as likely to win. This exercise will help you understand how different probability thresholds affect the final predicted label.
