# Running PyTorch Model Predictions

Great job learning how to make predictions with a trained PyTorch model! Now, let's get started by practicing running a simple prediction example using a trained model.

All you need to do is run the provided Python code. The code trains a neural network model, sets it to evaluation mode, disables gradient calculation, and makes a prediction for a given input tensor.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
