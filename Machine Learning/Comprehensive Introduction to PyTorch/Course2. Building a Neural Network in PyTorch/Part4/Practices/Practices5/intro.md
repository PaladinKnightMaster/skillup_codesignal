# Mastering PyTorch Model Predictions

Fantastic job learning how to use a trained `PyTorch` model for making predictions! Now, let's put your skills to the ultimate test. This time, you need to complete a Python script to use a trained neural network model to make a new prediction.

Your script should:

* Switch the model to evaluation mode.
* Disable gradient calculations.
* Make a prediction for the new input tensor
* Print the raw output and binary class label based on a threshold of `0.5`.
