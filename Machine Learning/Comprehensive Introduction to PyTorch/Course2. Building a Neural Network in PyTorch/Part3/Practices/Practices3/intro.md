# Fix Neural Network Training Code

Fantastic job on creating and training neural network models in PyTorch! Now, let's focus on identifying and fixing an issue related to the training process of our model.

The provided code is meant to train a neural network model. However, there is a critical step missing in the training loop, which is preventing the model from learning effectively. Without this step, the model parameters are not being updated as intended during each epoch.

Your task is to identify the missing step in the training loop and add it to ensure that the model trains correctly.
