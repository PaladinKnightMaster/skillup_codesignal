# Modifying Neural Network Learning Rate

In the previous lesson, you gained experience in defining neural network models, establishing loss functions, and setting up the training loop to train a neural network using `PyTorch`. To deepen your understanding, let's now do an experiment with one of the hyperparameters.

Your task is to modify the given code to change the learning rate to `0.01`. This will help you understand the impact of the learning rate and its importance in training neural networks.
