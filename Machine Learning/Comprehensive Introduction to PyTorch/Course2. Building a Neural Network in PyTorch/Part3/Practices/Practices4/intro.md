# Implementing Forward Pass in PyTorch

Great job on learning the fundamentals of training a neural network model in PyTorch! To solidify your understanding, hereâ€™s an exercise to practice setting up the forward pass in the training loop.

Your task is to fill in the missing code in the training loop below. Ensure that the data is passed through the model and predictions are made. Additionally, set the model to training mode, zero the gradients, and compute the loss. These are essential steps in the training process.
