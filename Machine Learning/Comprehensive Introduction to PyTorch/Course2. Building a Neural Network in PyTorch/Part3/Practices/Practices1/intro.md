# Running a Neural Network Training Loop

Great job learning how to train a neural network model in PyTorch! You've learned how to prepare data, set up the training loop, and monitor your training progress.

To ensure you've fully grasped the process, your task is to run and observe the provided code in Python, which trains a neural network model in PyTorch and prints the loss at certain intervals during the training.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
