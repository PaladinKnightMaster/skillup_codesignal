# From Model Training to Saving and Loading

Great job so far! In this task, your objective is to understand how to save and load a trained PyTorch model.

No changes to the code are needed; simply execute it to see the results. This exercise reinforces your ability to prepare models for deployment with PyTorch.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
