# Modifying Configuration and Descriptive Model Saving

Great progress so far! Earlier, you learned how to save and load a PyTorch model. Now, let's apply this by changing our model's hidden layer configuration.

Modify the code to change from two layers with 10 neurons each to one hidden layer with 15 neurons. Save the model as `wine_model_one_hidden.pth` and run the code to ensure it works correctly.

Using distinguishable file names like `wine_model_two_hidden.pth` and `wine_model_one_hidden.pth` helps track different model configurations. This practice allows easy switching during deployment and ensures reproducibility.
