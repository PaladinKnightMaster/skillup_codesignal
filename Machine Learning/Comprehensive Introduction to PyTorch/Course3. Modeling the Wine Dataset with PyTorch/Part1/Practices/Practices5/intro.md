# Preprocessing Wine Data for PyTorch

You've done an amazing job progressing through each task! Now comes the final exercise: putting everything together.

To demonstrate your understanding, you need to write a Python function that loads and preprocesses the Wine dataset from scratch using the steps you've learned:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Splitting it into training and testing sets
3. Scaling the features
4. Converting them into `PyTorch` tensors

Your function should return the processed tensors.
