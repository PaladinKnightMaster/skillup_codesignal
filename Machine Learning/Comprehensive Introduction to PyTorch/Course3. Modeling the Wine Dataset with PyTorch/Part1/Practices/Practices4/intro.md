# Converting Data to PyTorch Tensors

You've done an excellent job progressing through the tasks on preprocessing the Wine dataset for PyTorch! Now, let's practice the final step of preprocessing: converting scaled data to PyTorch tensors. You'll be given code that loads, splits, and scales the Wine dataset. Your task is to fill in the missing code to convert the scaled data into PyTorch tensors.
