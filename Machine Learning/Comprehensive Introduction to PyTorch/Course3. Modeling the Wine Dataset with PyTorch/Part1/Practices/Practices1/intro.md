# Loading the Wine Dataset

Great work on learning how to load and explore datasets using PyTorch and `sklearn`! For this task, you are provided with code that loads the Wine dataset and prints its features and target classes. Your job is simply to run the provided code and get to know better the data.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
