# Building a Classification Model

Great progress on developing the multi-class classification model!

In this task, your goal is to understand how to build and train a multi-class classification model using PyTorch. Specifically, we load the preprocessed Wine dataset, define a neural network model, set up the loss function and optimizer, and train the model for a set number of epochs.

No changes to the code are needed; simply run it to observe the results and understand each component better.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
