# Complete the PyTorch Model

Great progress on developing the multi-class classification model!

Now that you've seen it working in practice, let's see if you can implement a part of the code by yourself. In this exercise, you will fill in the missing parts of the code to define and compile a multi-class classification model using PyTorch. You will use methods and components such as `nn.Sequential`, `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, and `optim.Adam`.

Complete the code where you see `TODO` comments.
