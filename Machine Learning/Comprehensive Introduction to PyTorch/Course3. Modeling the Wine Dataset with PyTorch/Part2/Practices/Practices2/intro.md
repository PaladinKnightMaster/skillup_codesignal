# Changing Layers of PyTorch Model

You've done great so far in setting up the preprocessing and constructing basic neural network models. Now, let's make some changes to the code to see how different configurations affect training. In this task, modify the learning rate to `0.01`, train the model for `200` epochs and change the hidden layer to receive `5` inputs, do not forget to adjust the preceding layer accordingly.

These changes will help you understand the impact of different network architectures and optimization strategies. Run the code after making the changes to see the training results.
