# Defining and Training a Model

Having built the individual components of a multi-class classification model using `PyTorch`, it's now time to put everything you have learned into practice.

In this task, you will write the complete code from scratch to define, compile, and train the neural network model using the preprocessed Wine dataset.

This task will help consolidate your understanding by providing a hands-on opportunity to apply these concepts in a practical setting.
