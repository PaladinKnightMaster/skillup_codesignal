# Debugging PyTorch Model Training

Great progress on developing the multi-class classification model!

Now, let's put your skills to the test with a debugging task. Below is code designed to build and train a multi-class classification model, but apparently the modes of our model are not set as they should. Your task is to find and correct it. Debugging is a critical skill that will help you understand `PyTorch` better.
