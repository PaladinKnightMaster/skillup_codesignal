# Evaluating Model Performance in PyTorch

Nice work training your PyTorch model! Now, let's observe the evaluation process.

In this task, you will see how we evaluate the performance of a trained **PyTorch** model. The provided code trains a neural network using the Wine dataset and evaluates its performance by calculating `loss` and `accuracy`. Additionally, it visualizes the training and validation losses over epochs.

No changes to the code are needed; simply run it to see the results.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
