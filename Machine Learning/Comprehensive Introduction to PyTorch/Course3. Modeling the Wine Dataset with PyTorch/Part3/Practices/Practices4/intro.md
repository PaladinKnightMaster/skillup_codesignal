# Complete PyTorch Model Evaluation

Great progress so far! Now, let's see if you can complete some parts of the code by yourself.

In this exercise, you need to fill in the missing parts to evaluate and visualize the model's performance. This includes computing the accuracy and loss, but also preparing the data for plotting the training and validation loss.

Fill in the missing parts denoted by TODO comments.
