# Visualizing Model Performance with More Training

Great job so far! Now that you understand how the code works, let's make some changes to the training configuration.

Your task is to modify the code in order to visualize how the loss behaves with more training. Specifically, change the epochs to `200` instead of `150`.

Then, run the code to see how our model performs with further training.
