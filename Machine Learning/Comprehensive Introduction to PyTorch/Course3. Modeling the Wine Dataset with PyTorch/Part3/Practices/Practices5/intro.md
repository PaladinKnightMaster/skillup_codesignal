# Evaluate and Visualize Model Performance

Nice job understanding evaluation of `PyTorch` models! Now, let's put everything together.

This final task consolidates your understanding by having you write the evaluation code from scratch. Your goal is to define calculate the model's accuracy and loss on the test set, and finally visualize the training and validation losses.
