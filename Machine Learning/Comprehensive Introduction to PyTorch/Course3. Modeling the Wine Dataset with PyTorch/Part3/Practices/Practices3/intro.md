# Debugging PyTorch Model Evaluation

Nice work so far! Now, let's test your debugging skills with the `PyTorch` model we have been working on. Below is the code designed to train and evaluate a multi-class classification model using the Wine dataset, but something isn't right.

A common mistake has been introduced. Your task is to find and correct it. This practice will sharpen your understanding of model evaluation and accuracy calculation with `PyTorch` and `Scikit-Learn`.
