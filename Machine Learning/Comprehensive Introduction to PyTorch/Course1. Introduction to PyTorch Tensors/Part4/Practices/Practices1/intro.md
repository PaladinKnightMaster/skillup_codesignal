# Batch and Shuffle Data with PyTorch

Great job following along with the lesson!

In this task, we will create a simple dataset using PyTorch tensors, wrap it into a `TensorDataset`, and use a `DataLoader` to handle the batching and shuffling of the data. Simply run the code to see how the data is processed and observe the output.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
