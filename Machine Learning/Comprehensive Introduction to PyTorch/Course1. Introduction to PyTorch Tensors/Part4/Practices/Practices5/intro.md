# Creating Batched TensorDatasets

You have done well so far! Now it's time to put everything together and write code from scratch.

Your task is to:

1. Convert the arrays into PyTorch tensors with appropriate data types.
2. Create a `TensorDataset` from these tensors.
3. Use a `DataLoader` to handle batching and shuffling of the data with a batch size of 2.
4. Iterate through the `DataLoader` and print each batch.

This will test your understanding of defining arrays, converting them to tensors, using a `TensorDataset`, and using a `DataLoader` to manage batches and shuffling.
