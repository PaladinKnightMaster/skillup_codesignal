# Mastering PyTorch Tensor Operations

After practicing various tensor operations, it's time to solidify your understanding by implementing the operations from scratch. You are given three tensors and your mission is to perform addition, element-wise multiplication, matrix multiplication, and broadcasting to these tensors.

This task ensures that you can apply what you've learned about tensor operations effectively.
