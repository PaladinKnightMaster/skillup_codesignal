# Running Various Tensor Operations in PyTorch

Superb work so far! Now let's practice running a piece of Python code that uses `PyTorch` to create three tensors and perform different tensor operations like addition, multiplication, and broadcasting. Run the provided Python code and make sure you understand the results.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
