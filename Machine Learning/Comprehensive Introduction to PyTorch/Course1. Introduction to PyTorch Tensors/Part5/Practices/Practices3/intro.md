# Fix Linear Layer Usage

Great progress in understanding linear layers and activation functions. Now, let's take it a step further by debugging a piece of code.

The provided code should create a `linear layer` and apply both `ReLU` and `Sigmoid` activation functions. However, there's an issue preventing it from working correctly.

Your task is to identify and correct the error to ensure the code runs smoothly. This will improve your debugging skills and deepen your understanding of `PyTorch` functionality.
