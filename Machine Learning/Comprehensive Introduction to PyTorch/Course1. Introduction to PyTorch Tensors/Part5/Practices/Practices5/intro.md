# Processing Tensors with Neural Networks

You have made excellent progress in understanding linear layers and activation functions in PyTorch.

In this task, you'll apply what you've learned by writing the complete code to create a `linear` layer, and implement `ReLU` and `Sigmoid` activation functions on the linear output.

This exercise will solidify your ability to create and manipulate neural network layers in PyTorch.
