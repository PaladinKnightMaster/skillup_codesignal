# Running Tensor Reshaping and Flattening Code in PyTorch

Excellent! Now that we have learned about creating tensors and reshaping them using the `view()` method in PyTorch, it's time to put your skills into practice.

Here, we provide you with a `2x3` tensor. Your task is to run the given Python code that first reshapes this tensor into `3x2` and then flattens it into a one-dimensional tensor. Finally, printing out the original tensor, the reshaped tensor, and the flattened tensor.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
