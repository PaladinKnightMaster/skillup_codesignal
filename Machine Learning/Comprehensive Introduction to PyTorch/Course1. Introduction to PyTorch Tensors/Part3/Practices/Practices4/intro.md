# Flattening Tensors in PyTorch

Terrific! Now that you've grasped how to use the `view()` function to reshape tensors, let's add some challenge.

In the provided starter code, your task will be to fill in the missing part to perform an operation on a tensor. Specifically, you need to flatten it to a one-dimensional tensor.
