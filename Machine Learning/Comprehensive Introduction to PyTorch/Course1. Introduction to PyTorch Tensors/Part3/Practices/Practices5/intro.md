# Mastering Tensor Manipulations in PyTorch

Well done! You have become proficient at reshaping and flattening tensors. Now, as the final task for this lesson, you're going to put those skills to the test.

You are required to create a `4x2` tensor and reshape it to a new `2x4` tensor. Then, flatten the original tensor into a one-dimensional tensor. Lastly, you need to print out the original tensor, the reshaped tensor, and the flattened tensor.

This task requires you to write the solution from scratch, testing your mastery of the skills in reshaping and flattening tensors in PyTorch using the `view()` method that you have learned.
