# Reshaping Tensor Dimensions in PyTorch

Fantastic job reshaping and flattening tensors! Now, it's time to practice reshaping a tensor in a different way.

In the given starter code, you are provided with a `4x4` tensor. Your task is to change this tensor so that it becomes an `8x2` tensor.

Remember what you have learned about reshaping tensors.
