# Running Your First PyTorch Tensor Program

Great job on learning how to create tensors in PyTorch! Now, let's practice running a simple program to review what you've learned.

You need to run the provided Python code that uses `PyTorch` to create a tensor and display its properties.

Note: Before running, give us a moment to install PyTorch in the environment. We're setting up everything for your practice! 🛠️🔥
