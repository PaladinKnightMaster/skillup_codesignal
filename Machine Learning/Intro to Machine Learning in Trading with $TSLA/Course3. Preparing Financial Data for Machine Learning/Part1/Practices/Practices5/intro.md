# Tesla Stock Feature Engineering

Alright, Galactic Pioneer! Your final challenge is here. Write the code to load and manipulate *Tesla stock data*. You'll create new features, `Close-Low` and `Adj-Open`, from the dataset and then print the first 5 rows of these new features. Use the `Pandas` library and your feature engineering skills to complete the task!
