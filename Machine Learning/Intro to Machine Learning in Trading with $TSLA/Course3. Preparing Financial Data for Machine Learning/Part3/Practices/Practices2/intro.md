# Fix the Dataset Split

Hey, Space Explorer!

We've got a little bug to fix in the code that splits *Tesla's stock data* into training and testing sets. Try running the code and see if you can spot and fix the error. Remember to verify the shapes of the resulting datasets to ensure the split is correct.

Happy debugging!
