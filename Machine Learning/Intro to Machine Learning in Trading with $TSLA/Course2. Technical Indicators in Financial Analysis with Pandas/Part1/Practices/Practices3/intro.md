# Calculate and Visualize 20-day SMA for TSLA

Let's add some missing code to continue analyzing our data, Space Voyager!

We have already loaded the `$TSLA` stock data and pre-processed it, now we need to calculate the *20-day Simple Moving Average* (SMA) for the year 2018, and then to make sure it is visualized correctly.

Fill in the missing parts to complete the code.

Good luck!
