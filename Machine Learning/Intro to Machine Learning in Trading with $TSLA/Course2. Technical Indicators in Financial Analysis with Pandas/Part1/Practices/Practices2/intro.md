# Fix the Code to Visualize Stock Prices and SMA

Hey there, Space Explorer!

Your next mission: Find and fix the error in the code. The bug is stopping the code from correctly displaying the TSLA closing prices for 2018 and `SMA_20` on the plot. Inspect the code, debug it, and get that plot working smoothly.

Good luck!
