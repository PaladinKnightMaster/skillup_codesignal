# Evaluate Cross-Validation

A fantastic attempt, Space Explorer!

Your mission now is to evaluate the Gradient Boosting model using cross-validation. Find and fix the error in the code provided. The current code fails because of a logical error, not a typo.

Once fixed, the code should print the mean cross-validation score and visualize the predictions compared to the actual values.

Keep going!
