# Implementing a Gradient Boosting Regressor with Early Stopping

It's time for the final challenge! Your task is to implement a Gradient Boosting model with early stopping to predict Tesla's stock percentage change.

Follow the steps provided in the `TODO` comments. Remember to load and prepare the dataset, create new features, standardize them, split the data, train the model with and without early stopping, evaluate both models using `MSE`, and visualize the results.

The dataset is available at path_to_dataset/tsla-historic-prices.csv. Good luck!
