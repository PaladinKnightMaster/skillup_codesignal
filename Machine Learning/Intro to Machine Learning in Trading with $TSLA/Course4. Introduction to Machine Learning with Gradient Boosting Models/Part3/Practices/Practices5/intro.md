# Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV

Great job so far, Space Wanderer! Now, your mission is to implement the entire code from scratch to optimize a Gradient Boosting model. You will load the Tesla dataset, calculate technical indicators, and set up and train a model using GridSearchCV. Finally, you will evaluate and visualize the results. Letâ€™s tune those hyperparameters like a pro!
