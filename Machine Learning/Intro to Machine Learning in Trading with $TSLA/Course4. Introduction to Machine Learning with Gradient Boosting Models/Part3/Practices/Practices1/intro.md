# Adjusting Cross-Validation Folds in GridSearchCV

Fantastic job so far, Space Voyager!

Let's tweak our `GridSearchCV` settings. Change the `cv` parameter from `2` to `4` to perform 4-fold cross-validation instead of 2-fold. Additionally, let's modify our hyperparameter grid to try different options for `learning_rate` and `n_estimators` for potentially better model tuning. This adjustment will help us improve model validation accuracy.
